It is a work in progress while I continue gathering my thoughts. I believe I have worked on at least 30 software projects that have used some variation of the agile process, so I speak from experience.</p><h2 id="good-qualities">Good Qualities</h2><p>The agile process has many good qualities. These include:</p><ul><li>breaking up a project into stories, which helps to understand the scope of the work</li><li>allowing the customer to decide the order in which stories should be worked</li><li>allowing the customer to decide which stories should be in the next sprint</li><li>allowing the customer to stop the project if it isnâ€™t going well</li><li>providing a forum to share status, ask questions, and raise issues</li></ul><h2 id="cost-of-potential-benefits">Cost of Potential Benefits</h2><p>All the agile practices have potential benefits. But they also have real costs that the customer is paying. We should seek to minimize these costs when the potential benefits do not outweigh their cost.</p><h2 id="daily-standup-meetings">Daily Standup Meetings</h2><p>Agile meetings for software projects typically include EVERYONE involved on the team. This might include the following roles:</p><ul><li>customer</li><li>business project lead</li><li>business analyst</li><li>technical product lead</li><li>user interface designer</li><li>user experience designer</li><li>user interface developer</li><li>API (service) developer</li><li>database administrator</li><li>DevOps architect (responsible for cloud infrastructure, continuous integration, and continuous deployment)</li><li>developer of automated tests</li><li>manual tester</li></ul><p>In daily standup meetings it is common for people in many of these roles to report that they did not work on the project yesterday and have no tasks planned for today. They remain in the meeting to learn what others are doing because there is a possibility that it will affect their future tasks. These meetings typically take 15 to 20 minutes. Even though they are relatively short, given the number of participants and the fact that they occur daily, they are expensive.</p><p>Consider this analogy. You have decided to remodel your kitchen. It's a complete overhaul which will require a carpenter, electrician, plumber, cabinet installer, counter-top installer, painter, flooring installer, and interior decorator. There is a also a person that is coordinating all of the work.</p><p>The project coordinator informs you that they are going to use an agile process that includes having a standup meeting every morning. How do you feel about paying the hourly rate of each of these people to discuss your remodeling project for 20 minutes every morning?</p><p>How do feel about paying for the entire team participate in meetings to plan the tasks (stories) and estimate how long they will take? Do you want the painter to participate in estimating how long it will take to wire the garbage disposal?</p><p>How do feel about paying for the entire team have a meeting at the end of every two week period of work (sprint) to discuss what went well, what went wrong, and what practices should continue (retrospective)?</p><p>I imagine some readers will claim that a home remodeling project is very different from a software project, but I think they are more similar than some are willing to admit. I invite explanations about how they are different.</p><h2 id="project-estimates">Project Estimates</h2><p>One way to address the cost of including all team members in all agile meetings it to include it in initial project estimates. Doing so will necessarily increase the estimated project cost. It will likely also result in some project proposals being rejected because the cost is higher than the customer is willing to pay.</p><p>We need to find a way to reduce these costs in order to increase the likelihood of project proposals being accepted.</p><h2 id="story-points">Story points</h2><p>Story points were invented because humans are bad at estimating the actual time required for tasks. They are fictional units of measure that are meant to represent both time and complexity. The theory is that over time each team will learn what a &quot;point&quot; actually represent for them.</p><p>The idea that a team can learn over time the value of a point seems no more realistic that the idea that over time a team can become better at estimating the actual time it will take to complete tasks. And those estimates would be more meaningful to project stake holds than points.</p><p>Story points also serve as a way to avoid criticism for bad estimates. When a story runs long, a team can just say they are still determining what a point means for their team.</p><h2 id="velocity">Velocity</h2><p>One claimed benefit of using story points is that they can be used to measure the velocity of a team which helps in predicting the amount of work that can be completed in a future sprint. However, this isn't as accurate as one might hope.</p><p>One reason is that story point estimates typically are not allowed to assume the experience level of the person that will work on the story. For example, suppose there is a story to implement an elaborate bar chart that supports data filtering and sorting. If this story can be assigned to anyone on the team, the time required to complete it can vary significantly. Someone that is new to this kind of development might require two weeks to complete the story, while someone that has done something similar many times might complete the story in one day. So how many points should be assigned to the story? If a middle ground is selected then when the story is completed, the team velocity will rise or fall depending on the experience level of the developer that works on the story. So what is the value of the calculated velocity?</p><h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2><p>I know these will be perceived as agile blasphemy, but here are my recommendations for changes to the typical agile process.</p><h3 id="standup-meetings">Standup meetings</h3><p>Only team members that are actively working on the project should be invited. This means the participants will change over the life of the project. If there has been a change in direction that will affect someone not attending or if there is question that requires input from someone not attending, plan a separate meeting to discuss the issue among the affected parties.</p><h3 id="story-writing-and-elaboration">Story writing and elaboration</h3><p>For each story, identify the team member who is most familiar with the required work and ask them to write the first draft of the story description that includes acceptance criteria and an estimate. Do not make it a team exercise to write stories because the cost of doing that is too high.</p><p>Once there is an initial draft of many stories, have a separate meeting to review each set of related stories and provide input. Only invite those familiar with work to be done and those that will be affected by it. Do not force team members to provide estimates for stories that are outside of their expertise.</p><h3 id="retrospectives">Retrospectives</h3><p>These meetings occur at the end of each sprint and ask each member to identify things that went well, went poorly, and should continue. This sounds good in theory, but consider how often something of consequence comes out of these meetings and measure that against the cost of running them.</p><p>Team members should be encouraged to raise an issues at the end of every daily standup meeting. There is no reason to wait until the end of a sprint to raise an issue.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Time is money and the customer is paying for it. Don't spend time on things you would not be willing to pay for if you were the one footing the bill.</p></article>
