I have not found any that fit the bill, though, so I created web-translate, an open source library that can be obtained via npm at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-translate?v=1.0.12" rel="noopener" target="_blank">web-translate</a>.</p><p>The web-translate library provides a set of JavaScript functions and a command that make translating English to another language in web applications easy! It is not specific to any framework and should work with all the popular choices, including React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular.</p><p>The translations are performed as a build step, so no cost for translation services is incurred during web application usage.</p><p>See my Object Computing (OCI) article <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/september-2018-web-translate-javascript-library?v=1.0.12" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Building Multilingual Web Apps with web-translate</a>.</p></article>
