In order to support users that do not upgrade their operating system frequently, apps often must wait a year or more to incorporate the use of new APIs.</p></li></ul><h3 id="cons">Cons</h3><ul><li><p>Multiple implementations required</p><p>Separated code bases are needed to support each mobile operating system. This typically requires employing a separate team for each operating system.</p></li><li><p>Deployment/update process</p><p>The initial deployment of native apps and subsequent updates both require waiting for app store approval. This introduces a delay in making apps available to users.</p></li><li><p>Developers availability</p><p>There are many more experienced web developers than there are developers experienced in targeting specific mobile operating systems.</p></li></ul><h2 id="cross-platform">Cross-Platform</h2><p>The most popular cross-platform mobile frameworks are React Native and Flutter.</p><h3 id="pros-1">Pros</h3><ul><li><p>Single implementation</p><p>Cross-platform apps can target Android and iOS with the same code base.</p></li><li><p>Access to platform features</p><p>Cross-platform apps typically have more access to platform features than web apps, but less than native apps. Native code can be written to bridge the gap, making all platform features available. But the need to write some native code negates some of the benefit of using a cross-platform framework.</p></li></ul><h3 id="cons-1">Cons</h3><ul><li><p>Performance</p><p>Performance is typically worse than native apps, but better than web apps.</p></li><li><p>Application size</p><p>The size of cross-platform apps is typically larger than native apps and smaller than web apps.</p></li><li><p>Deployment/update process</p><p>The deployment process for cross platform apps is the same as for native apps. Waiting for app store approval is required. However, some cross-platform frameworks (only JavaScript-based ones) remove the need for updates to undergo app store approval.</p></li><li><p>Developer availability</p><p>The number of developers that have experience with a particular cross-platform framework is likely less than those with experience in native and web frameworks.</p></li></ul><h2 id="responsive-web">Responsive Web</h2><p>Any web framework can be used to build a responsive web app.</p><h3 id="pros-2">Pros</h3><ul><li><p>Can target most mobile operating systems with the same code base.</p></li><li><p>Deployment/update process</p><p>Users do not need to install the web apps. They only need to open a mobile web browser and enter the URL of the app, or click a link to the app in an email or text message.</p><p>For apps that will be used repeatedly, users can bookmark the app in their mobile web browser or create a home screen icon for launching the app without explicitly opening their mobile web browser.</p><p>Updates can be deployed without permission from an app store. All that is required is to redeploy the web app to a server.</p></li><li><p>Developer availability</p><p>There are a large number of developers that are experienced in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and specific web frameworks.</p></li></ul><h3 id="cons-2">Cons</h3><ul><li><p>Performance</p><p>Web applications have the worst performance.</p></li><li><p>Application size</p><p>Web applications tend to have the largest application size. However, depending on how the app is implemented, it may not be necessary to download all of the code to mobile devices. Some of the code can only run on a server.</p></li><li><p>Access to platform features</p><p>Basic platform features such as camera access and geolocation are available through web APIs, but more advanced features may not be available.</p></li><li><p>Browser caching</p><p>Browser caching can prevent users from getting app updates. A cache busting strategy must be employed to prevent this issue.</p></li></ul></article>
