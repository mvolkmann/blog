Native code can be written to bridge the gap, making all platform features available. The need to write native code negates some of the benefit of using a cross-platform framework.

Waiting for app store approval is required. However, some cross-platform frameworks (those that are JavaScript-based) remove the need for updates to undergo app store approval.</p></li><li><p>Developer availability</p><p>The number of developers that have experience with a particular cross-platform framework is likely less than those with experience in native and web frameworks.</p></li></ul><h2 id="responsive-web" tabindex="-1">Responsive Web</h2><p>Any web framework can be used to build a responsive web app.</p><h3 id="pros-2" tabindex="-1">Pros</h3><ul><li><p>Single implementation</p><p>Responsive web apps can target Android and iOS with the same code base.</p></li><li><p>Deployment/update process</p><p>Users do not need to install web apps.

Despite this the performance is acceptable for many applications.</p></li><li><p>Application size</p><p>Web applications tend to have the largest application size. However, depending on how the app is implemented, it may not be necessary to download all of the code to mobile devices. Some of the code reside and run on a server.</p></li><li><p>Access to platform features</p><p>Basic platform features such as camera access and geolocation are available through web APIs, but more advanced features may not be available.

A cache busting strategy must be employed to prevent this issue.</p></li></ul></article>
