This setting can be found at Cursor ... Settings ... Cursor Settings ... General ... Privacy mode. It seems this is enabled by default, but double-check it.</p><p>Cursor depends on several &quot;subprocessors&quot; where code is sent in order to respond to queries. So Cursor is only as secure as those subprocessors which include:</p><ul><li>AWS - hosts Cursor infrastructure</li><li>Fireworks - hosts custom AI models on servers in the United States, Tokyo, and London.</li><li>Open AI - provides models that are used to give AI responses</li><li>Anthropic - provides models that are used to give AI responses</li><li>Google Cloud Vertex API - provides Gemini models that are used to give AI responses</li><li>Turbopuffer - stores obfuscated code on Google Cloud servers in the United States</li><li>Exa and SerpApi - used for web searches</li><li>MongoDB - used for analytics data when privacy mode is not enabled</li><li>Datadog</li><li>Databricks</li><li>Foundary</li><li>Voltage Park</li><li>Slack</li><li>Google Workspace</li><li>Pinecone</li><li>Amplitude</li><li>Hashicorp</li><li>Stripe</li><li>Vercel</li><li>WorkOS</li></ul><p>TODO: Finish document what each subprocessor above is used for.</p><p>TODO: Explain what enabling privacy mode does.</p><p>TODO: Add more detail from <a href="https://www.cursor.com/security">https://www.cursor.com/security</a>.</p><p>TODO: Can Cursor be configured to never upload any of our source code?</p><p>TODO: Can Cursor be configured to not use our source code to train its models?</p><h2 id="functionality" tabindex="-1">Functionality</h2><p>Cursor provides the following functionality:</p><ul><li>Predicts your next edit which can be accepted by pressing the tab key.</li><li>Answers questions about the codebase of your current project.</li><li>Enables writing code with natural language instead of specific programming language syntax.</li></ul><h2 id="paid-vs.-free-versions" tabindex="-1">Paid vs. Free Versions</h2><p>TODO: What features does the paid version add?</p><h2 id="advice" tabindex="-1">Advice</h2><p>For best results, make detailed requests rather than general ones. For example, requesting &quot;Write a todo app&quot; is too general. Have a clear vision of what you want to build.</p><h2 id="chat-attempt-%231---fail!" tabindex="-1">Chat Attempt #1 - FAIL!</h2><p>Press cmd-i (macOS) or ctrl-i (others) to open Chat mode. Requests entered here can create and/or edit multiple source files. For example, &quot;Create a web application that allows users to select a kind of food such as Chinese or Mexican from a drop-down menu. Then display on a Google Map all the matching restaurants within 10 miles of the current location of the user. Use the latest version of Svelte.&quot;</p><p>This will prompt for permission to run specific commands. If this runs for a long time, it may be prompting for more information or there may be an error. To see this, click &quot;Pop out terminal&quot;.</p><p>In my case it told me &quot;create-svelte has been deprecated&quot; and that &quot;npm create svelte&quot; has been replaced with &quot;npx sv create&quot;. So I entered the following in the chat: &quot;You tried to use &quot;npm create svelte@latest&quot;, but create-svelte has been deprecated. You need to use &quot;npx sv create&quot; instead.&quot;</p><p>I once again had to click &quot;Pop out terminal&quot; where I was asked several questions related to creating a new Svelte project. After answering them, the project was created in my home directory in a new directory named &quot;restaurant-finder&quot;.</p><p>Instructions for running the project were output. These included optional commands to create a local git repository. It did not suggest running <code>npm install</code>, but that is required.</p><p>The command to run the app failed due to an issue with optional dependencies. I had to delete the <code>package-lock.json</code> file and the <code>node_modules</code> directory, and then run <code>npm install</code> again which worked.</p><p>Enhance the project code with followup requests. For example, &quot;Instead of displaying default map markers for each restaurant, display their Yelp rating.&quot;</p><p>Back in Cursor I clicked the &quot;Open Project&quot; button and selected the new project directory. This contained a fresh Svelte project with none of the code I requested.</p><p>I requested the following in the chat: &quot;Modify the web application to allow users to select a kind of food such as Chinese or Mexican from a drop-down menu. Then display on a Google Map all the matching restaurants within 10 miles of the current location of the user.&quot; This ran for a couple of minutes. Then I press cmd-return to accept all the changes.</p><p>This output the following request: &quot;Also, please make sure to provide your Google Maps API key by replacing the empty string in the Map.svelte component. The application won't work without a valid API key.&quot;</p><p>I asked it &quot;How can I put the Google Maps API key in a .env file that is not commited to Git so I can keep it secret?&quot; It created a <code>.env</code> file for me and modified <code>Map.svelte</code> to use it. I modified the <code>.env</code> file to use a Google Maps API key from a previous project.</p><p>I ran <code>npm install</code> again to install new dependencies that were added.</p><p>I ran <code>npm run dev</code> to start a local web server and browsed localhost:3000.</p><h2 id="chat-attempt-%232" tabindex="-1">Chat Attempt #2</h2><p>Open a chat. One way is to open the command palette and select &quot;New Chat&quot;. Another way is to press cmd-i (macOS) or ctrl-i (others).</p><p>Requests entered here can create and/or edit multiple source files. For example, &quot;Create a Svelte project in a directory named &quot;restaurant-finder&quot;. This will suggest commands to run to create the project. For each command, click the &quot;Run command&quot; button (or press cmd-return) to run it. Click &quot;Pop out terminal&quot; in order to answer questions being asked by <code>npx sv create</code>.</p><p>Ask Cursor to customize the default application. For example, &quot;Change the main page to contain a drop-down from which users can select a kind of food such as Chinese or Mexican.&quot;</p><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocMOZpuAMw4?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cursor Tutorial for Beginners</a></li><li></li></ul></article>
