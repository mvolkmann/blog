Please upgrade to Pro, switch to the 'default' model, Claude 3.7 sonnet, another model, or try again in a few moments.&quot; This makes the free tier somewhat unusable.</p><p>The paid tiers start at $20 per month.</p><p>It works best when given a somewhat detailed plan of what it should build. This includes identifying the frameworks and libraries to use.</p><p>When Cursor is asked to implement code for a specific task, it provides a detailed explanation of the code it generates and gives the developer an opportunity to review the code before accepting it. It can be very tempting to accept the code without reviewing it, especially if the app is running and live reload indicates that the desired result is achieved. Developers need to resist the urge to skip reviewing the code.</p><p>Every piece of text in the Cursor chat pane is a clickable link that leads to the original or modified code, or related documentation.</p><h2 id="installing" tabindex="-1">Installing</h2><p>Click a download button on the <a href="https://www.cursor.com.?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cursor home page</a>.

I tried this, but the cursor servers were too busy to do this using the free tier.</p><h2 id="paid-vs.-free-versions" tabindex="-1">Paid vs. Free Versions</h2><p>TODO: What features does the paid version add?</p><h2 id="advice" tabindex="-1">Advice</h2><p>For best results, make detailed requests rather than general ones. For example, requesting &quot;Write a todo app&quot; is too general. Have a clear vision of what you want to build.</p><h2 id="chat-attempt-%231%3A-svelte---fail!" tabindex="-1">Chat Attempt #1: Svelte - FAIL!</h2><p>Press cmd-i (macOS) or ctrl-i (others) to open Chat mode. Requests entered here can create and/or edit multiple source files. For example, &quot;Create a web application that allows users to select a kind of food such as Chinese or Mexican from a drop-down menu. Then display on a Google Map all the matching restaurants within 10 miles of the current location of the user. Use the latest version of Svelte.&quot;</p><p>This will prompt for permission to run specific commands. If this runs for a long time, it may be prompting for more information or there may be an error. To see this, click &quot;Pop out terminal&quot;.</p><p>In my case it told me &quot;create-svelte has been deprecated&quot; and that &quot;npm create svelte&quot; has been replaced with &quot;npx sv create&quot;. So I entered the following in the chat: &quot;You tried to use &quot;npm create svelte@latest&quot;, but create-svelte has been deprecated. You need to use &quot;npx sv create&quot; instead.&quot;</p><p>I once again had to click &quot;Pop out terminal&quot; where I was asked several questions related to creating a new Svelte project. After answering them, the project was created in my home directory in a new directory named &quot;restaurant-finder&quot;.</p><p>Instructions for running the project were output. These included optional commands to create a local git repository. It did not suggest running <code>npm install</code>, but that is required.</p><p>The command to run the app failed due to an issue with optional dependencies. I had to delete the <code>package-lock.json</code> file and the <code>node_modules</code> directory, and then run <code>npm install</code> again which worked.</p><p>Enhance the project code with followup requests. For example, &quot;Instead of displaying default map markers for each restaurant, display their Yelp rating.&quot;</p><p>Back in Cursor I clicked the &quot;Open Project&quot; button and selected the new project directory. This contained a fresh Svelte project with none of the code I requested.</p><p>I requested the following in the chat: &quot;Modify the web application to allow users to select a kind of food such as Chinese or Mexican from a drop-down menu. Then display on a Google Map all the matching restaurants within 10 miles of the current location of the user.&quot; This ran for a couple of minutes. Then I press cmd-return to accept all the changes.</p><p>This output the following request: &quot;Also, please make sure to provide your Google Maps API key by replacing the empty string in the Map.svelte component. The application won't work without a valid API key.&quot;</p><p>I asked it &quot;How can I put the Google Maps API key in a .env file that is not committed to Git so I can keep it secret?&quot; It created a <code>.env</code> file for me and modified <code>Map.svelte</code> to use it. I modified the <code>.env</code> file to use a Google Maps API key from a previous project.</p><p>I ran <code>npm install</code> again to install new dependencies that were added.</p><p>I ran <code>npm run dev</code> to start a local web server and browsed localhost:3000.</p><h2 id="chat-attempt-%232%3A-svelte---fail!" tabindex="-1">Chat Attempt #2: Svelte - FAIL!</h2><p>Creating a new SvelteKit project is somewhat complicated at the moment, so I did that manually and then opened that project in Cursor.</p><p>I entered the following in the chat:</p><ul><li><p>Create a component that renders a drop-down for selecting a cuisine like Chinese or Mexican and use it in the main page.</p></li><li><p>Alphabetize the cuisines in the drop-down.</p></li><li><p>Prettier complains that CuisineSelector.svelte should include a key for each block.

The second issue is that <code>src/components/__tests__/RestaurantMap.test.tsx</code> gives a &quot;Geolocation error&quot;.</p></li><li><p>When I run the tests I get a Geolocation error in RestaurantMap.test.tsx. Fix this.</p><p>There are SO MANY errors in the tests now. Honestly I'm tired of fighting with Cursor. The app works fine, but the tests do not.</p></li></ul><h2 id="nim-game" tabindex="-1">Nim Game</h2><ul><li><p>Create a web app using Svelte that implements a Nim game with three rows containing 3, 5, and 7 pink tabs on a black background. Allow the user to choose whether they go first or the computer goes first. Then play out the game until there is a winner.</p></li><li><p>Change the game so at each turn the player can take any number of tabs from a single row.</p></li><li><p>Change the game so the player that takes the last tab loses.</p><p>It claimed to make this change, but is still wrong. And the computer does use good logic in its moves.</p></li></ul><p>Overall Cursor did a decent job at generating this app.</p><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary</h2><p>Cursor is a very useful tool and I recommend allowing all developers to have access to it. However:</p><ul><li>Developers must still be able to distinguish between good and bad code. Junior developers are unlikely to achieve good results.</li><li>The tool works best when it is sent detailed requests. For example, instead of asking &quot;Write a todo application&quot;, ask &quot;Write a todo web application using the React framework and use Tailwind for styling.&quot;</li><li>There is a strong temptation to just accept all the generated code and not review it. This temptation must be resisted.</li><li>Often when asking the tool to add a feature or fix a problem, it introduces new problems.</li><li>Using the tool to build a non-trivial application is generally not possible in a single request. Instead, a dialog with the tool that is composed of many requests is needed.</li></ul><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocMOZpuAMw4?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cursor Tutorial for Beginners</a></li></ul></article>
