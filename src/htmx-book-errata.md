  The command to install bun should have been formatted as a code block.
  Ignore the `~~~` characters.

- p. 4 Code block titles

  The directory names in code block titles (e.g. "JumpingIn" on this page),
  refer to the directory inside the code download at
  <https://media.pragprog.com/titles/mvhtmx/code/mvhtmx-code.zip>.
  You can choose different names for directories, such as "htmx-demo",
  if you are recreating the examples on your own.
