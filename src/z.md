## Overview

You might be using the terminal all wrong ...
or at least not as efficiently as you could.
Here are ten tips to improve your terminal usage.

## Fonts

Everything looks better in a terminal that is configured to use a nice font!

Personal preference enters in here.
I prefer a monospace font, meaning all characters have the same width.
I also prefer fonts that support ligatures which Google describes as follows:

> A ligature is a glyph that combines the shapes of
> certain sequences of characters into a new form
> that makes for a more harmonious reading experience.

For example, an exclamation point followed by an equal sign
(meaning not equal) is replaced by an equal sign with a slash through it.

Here is some Swift code that can take advantage of ligatures
for the character sequences `->` and `>=`.

```swift
func max(n1: Double, n2: Double) -> Bool {
    n1 >= n2 ? n1 : n2
}
```

And here is the same code displayed with ligatures:

<img alt="font ligatures" style="width: 60%"
  src="/blog/assets/font-ligatures.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="font ligatures">

My current favorite monospace font that supports ligatures is {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads", "FiraCode Nerd Font" %}.

Note: Warp terminal does not currently display ligatures in block output
({% aTargetBlank "https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp/issues/239",
"issue 239" %}).

## Change Directory

If your work involves switching between projects during a typical day
then you likely use the `cd` command quite a bit.
A great time saver is to define aliases in your shell configuration file
to quickly move to your most commonly used directories.
For example, if you use the zsh shell then you could
add the following in your `~/.zshrc` file

```bash
export DOCUMENTS_DIR=$HOME/Documents

# This directory holds on the files related to my blog
# that is implemented using the Eleventy static site generator.
export BLOG_DIR=$DOCUMENTS_DIR/blog

# This directory contains subdirectories related to software development.
export DEV_DIR=$DOCUMENTS_DIR/dev

# This directory contains subdirectories for projects.
export PROJECTS_DIR=$DOCUMENTS_DIR/projects

# This directory contains subdirectories for documentation and code examples
# in various programming languages.
export LANG_DIR=$DEV_DIR/lang

# This directory contains Swift documentation and code examples.
export SWIFT_DIR=$LANG_DIR/swift

alias cdblog="cd $BLOG_DIR"
alias cddev="cd $DEV_DIR"
alias cdjs="cd $JS_DIR"
alias cdprojects="cd $PROJECTS_DIR"
alias cdswift="cd $SWIFT_DIR"
```

## Command-line Git

If you sometimes work with Git from the command-line,
defining the following aliases and shell functions can make this easier.
Use these when you are in or below the root directory of a git repository.

{% raw %}

```bash
# This lists all the local branches in the current git repository.
alias br="git branch"

# This prompts for a commit message using Vim.
# Diffs for all the modified files are displayed inside Vim
# so they can be verified and serve as the basis for a good commit message.
# After a message is entered and saved (:wq),
# it commits all the modified files.
alias ci="git commit -av"

# This creates a new branch off of the current branch
# with the name specified after `cob`.
# For example, `cob feature-compute-score`.
alias cob="git checkout -b"

# This checks out the branch specified after `co`.
# For example, `co feature-compute-score`.
alias co="git checkout"

# This lists all the commits on the current branch from newest to oldest.
# For each commit the SHA, author, date, and commit message are output.
alias log="git log"

# This deletes the local AND remote branches with a given name.
# For example, `rmb feature-compute-score`.
alias rmb="$HOME/bin/rmb" # defined below

# This outputs lists of all modified, deleted, and untracked files.
alias status="git status"

# This cd's up to root directory of current git repository.
function cdgitroot() {
  cd `git rev-parse --git-dir`
  cd ..
}

# This pulls down the latest changes from the remote branch
# that corresponds to the current local branch.
function pull() {
  git pull origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
}

# This pushes the latest changes on the current local branch
# up to the corresponding remote branch.
function push() {
  git push origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
}
```

{% endraw %}

Here is the shell script `rmb` that must be in a directory
listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

{% raw %}

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Removes a given git branch, both local and remote.

if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
  echo usage: rmb {branch-name}
  exit 1
fi

git branch -d $1
git branch -rd origin/$1
```

{% endraw %}

## Avoid Accidents

The `cp` (copy), `mv` (move), and `rm` (remove) commands can result in
loss of data if a file is accidentally replaced or removed.
To avoid this, define the following aliases that
shadow those commands with a version that prompts for permission
before overwriting or deleting a file.

```bash
# Ask for confirmation before overwriting or deleting files.
alias cp="cp -i"
alias mv="mv -i"
alias rm="rm -i"
```

## Kill Processes

Here's a common scenario.
You attempt to start a server that listens on port 3000,
but you get the error "Something is already running on port 3000".
You currently have ten shells open in various terminal windows and panes.
If you could find the one what is running a server using port 3000
you could navigate to it and press ctrl-c to kill it.
But finding it takes too long.

It would be much more convenient if you could enter a command
that would kill the process that is listening on a given port.
You can with `klp 3000`!

```bash
alias klp="kill-listening-process"
```

Ths script `kill-listening-process` will differ somewhat
based on the operating system.
For macOS it can be defined as follows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# This kills the process listening on a given port.

if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
  echo usage: kill-listening-process {port}
  exit 1
fi

port=$1
pid=$(lsof -n -iTCP:$port -sTCP:LISTEN -t)

if [[ $pid ]]; then
  kill $pid
  echo killed process $pid
else
  echo no process is listening on port $port
fi
```

## Search For Files

There are multiple ways to search for files in and below the current directory
that have a specific file extension and contain given text.
One way is to use the `find` command as follows:

```bash
find . -name '*.js' | xargs grep 'some text'
find . -type f -name '*.js' -exec grep 'some text'
```

This has several issues. The syntax is hard to remember, it is somewhat slow,
the output doesn't indicate the line numbers where matches were found,
and the output is not color-coded.

A better alternative is to use {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep", "ripgrep" %}.
This link contains installation instructions for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Ripgrep is implemented in Rust and is very fast.

The equivalent of the `find` command above is `rg --type=js 'some text'`.

The paths to files that contain the text are displayed in purple.
Matching line numbers are displayed in green.
Text on the matching lines is displayed in white,
except the matching text which is displayed in red.

## Starship

{% aTargetBlank "https://starship.rs/", "Starship" %} is a
highly customizable tool for customizing shell prompts.
It works in nearly all shells including
Bash, Fish, Nushell, Powershell, and Zsh.
This removes the need to customize the prompt in shell-specific ways.

Starship can be configured in one place for all shells,
which is great for developers that utilize multiple shells.

To use Starship with zsh, add the following line in `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

Configure Starship by creating the file `~/.config/starship.toml`.
Here is my configuration. Note the use of unicode characters.

```toml
format = "$shell$custom$git_branch$git_status$directory$character "

# Displays text, typically a single character,
# based on the status of the previous command.
[character]
success_symbol = "[‚ñ∂](green)" # normal prompt
error_symbol = "[‚úó](bold red)" # used if previous command failed

# Displays current directory.
[directory]
format = "[$path]($style)"
style = "yellow"
truncate_to_repo = false
truncation_length = 3 # parent directories to show; default is 3
truncation_symbol = "‚Ä¶/"

# Displays current Git branch when in a directory of a Git repository.
[git_branch]
format = "[$symbol ](green)[$branch ]($style)"
style = "italic green"
symbol = "ÔÑì"

# Displays status of Git repository when in a directory of a Git repository.
[git_status]
format = "[$all_status$ahead_behind]($style)"
ahead = "‚á° $count "
behind = "‚á£ $count "
deleted = "üóë $count "
diverged = "Ôó∫ $count "
stashed = "üì¶ $count "
modified = "Ô≠é $count "
staged = '[ÔÅß $count ](green)'
renamed = "Ôëö $count "
untracked = "ü§∑ ‚Äç$count "
style = "bold red"

[shell]
disabled = false
bash_indicator = "üöÄ"
fish_indicator = "üê†"
nu_indicator = "ü¶Ä"
zsh_indicator = "üßô"
```

"https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog/topics/#/blog/starship/", "Starship" %}.

## Command-line Editing

In many terminal programs, the following keyboard shortcuts can be used
to move the cursor within a command being entered:

| Action                     | Shortcut Key          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| move to beginning of line  | ctrl-a                |
| move to end of line        | ctrl-e                |
| move back one word         | meta-b                |
| move forward one word      | meta-f                |
| move back one character    | ctrl-b or left arrow  |
| move forward one character | ctrl-f or right arrow |

Most terminal programs do not support using a mouse or track pad
to position the cursor by clicking within a command being entered.
However, this is supported by the
{% aTargetBlank "https://www.warp.dev", "Warp" %} terminal.

pressing ctrl-a moves the cursor to the beginning of the line and pressing ctrl-e
Learn how to perform basic editing in your selected shell.

To clear what has been entered, press ctrl-u.

## Vim

Many software developers know a little bit about Vim and
grudgingly use it when nothing else is available.
You don't need to be an expert in Vim or customize it
in order to derive a lot of its benefits.

In macOS and Linux, vim is already installed.
Despite this, I recommend installing
{% aTargetBlank "https://neovim.io", "neovim" %}
which is a modern replacement for Vim.
Click the "Install Now" button at the link above
for installation instructions.
In macOS it can be installed using the Homebrew command
`brew install neovim`.

For a summary of the minimal set of commands you need to know
to be productive in vim or neovim, see my {% aTargetBlank
"https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog/topics/#/blog/vim/", "Vim blog page" %}.
Especially see the section on netrw.

Perhaps you are a fan of {% aTargetBlank "https://code.visualstudio.com/",
"VS Code" %} and prefer for avoid using any flavor of Vim.
Enter `vscode .` in a terminal to launch VS Code use it to
edit any files in and below the current directory.

# Windows, Tabs, and Panes

You likely find yourself working on multiple projects throughout the day.
It is convenient to keep the terminal sessions related to each project
in a separate window or tab of a single window.
Each of these can contain multiple panes
where separate terminal sessions are running.
This allows you to focus on a task at hand
by switching to a specific window or tab.

Options for managing terminal windows, tabs, and panes include
iTerm2, tmux, and Warp. Can the macOS terminal app do this?

For example, perhaps you editing your blog and working on two projects.
Create a separate tab for each of these whose names are "blog"
and the project names.
Inside each tab create multiple panes by splitting the initially pane
horizontally, vertically, or both.
In the panes of a project tab you can run a web server, an API server,
and a database server. Other panes can be used for executing shell commands.

## Fun

The terminal is not just for work, it can also be fun.
If you are a macOS user and you have {% aTargetBlank
"https://brew.sh/", "Homebrew" %} installed, try these.

- asciiquarium

  Enter `brew install asciiquarium` followed by `asciiquarium`
  to fill your terminal with an animated aquarium
  made entirely of ASCII characters.
  Press ctrl-c to exit.

  <img alt="asciiquarium" style="width: 100%"
    src="/blog/assets/asciiquarium.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="asciiqarium">

- cmatrix

  Enter `brew install cmatrix` followed by `cmatrix`
  to fill your terminal with an animation from the movie "The Matrix".
  Press ctrl-c to exit.

  <img alt="cmatrix" style="width: 100%"
    src="/blog/assets/cmatrix.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="cmatrix">

- myman

  Enter `brew install myman` followed by `myman`
  to play a version of the game Tetris in the terminal.
  Press ctrl-c to exit.

  <img alt="myman" style="width: 100%"
    src="/blog/assets/myman.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="myman">

- ninvaders

  Enter `brew install ninvaders` followed by `ninvaders`
  to play a version of the game Space Invaders in the terminal.
  Press ctrl-c to exit.

  <img alt="ninvaders" style="width: 100%"
    src="/blog/assets/ninvaders.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="ninvaders">

- tetris

  Enter `brew install samtay/tui/tetris` followed by `tetris`
  to play the game Tetris in the terminal.
  Press q to quit.

  <img alt="tetris" style="width: 100%"
    src="/blog/assets/tetris.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="tetris">

## Other Shells

{% aTargetBlank "https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog/topics/#/blog/nushell/",
"Nushell" %} is "a new type of shell".
"The goal of this project is to take the Unix philosophy of shells,
where pipes connect simple commands together,
and bring it to the modern style of development."

The output of many commands is a table
and there are many commands for manipulating tables.

TODO: Get more content from https://www.nushell.sh/.

## Use Warp

TODO: Remove this section, but refer to your Warp blog page somewhere.

There are many options for terminal applications.
In macOS you can use the built-in Terminal app.
A popular alternative is {% aTargetBlank "https://iterm2.com", "iTerm2" %}.
Many developers using iTerm2 in conjunction with {% aTargetBlank
"https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog/topics/#/blog/tmux/", "tmux" %}
in order to gain features such as multiple tabs that each contain split panes
where each pane hosts a separate shell session.

{% aTargetBlank "https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog/topics/#/blog/warp/",
"Warp" %} is a fairly new option, currently only supported on macOS,
that provides most of the features of iTerm2 and tmux.
It also adds many features not found in those tools such as
command "blocks", better command editing capability, workflows,
a command palette, provided and custom themes,
permalinks to commands and their output, and "AI Command Search".

AI Command Search helps with discovering the shell command needed
to perform a task described in English.
For example, searching for "delete remote git branch"
suggests `git push origin --delete <branch>`.

Warp makes it easy to create a separate tab
for each category of work being done.
This allows you to focus on a task at hand.
To switch tasks, just click a different tab.

For example, perhaps you editing your blog and working on two projects.
Create a separate tab for each of these whose names are "blog"
and the project names.
Inside each tab create multiple panes by splitting the initially pane
horizontally, vertically, or both.
In the panes of a project tab you can run a web server, an API server,
and a database server. Other panes can be used for executing shell commands.

TODO: Add some screenshots!

Warp supports the Bash, Zsh, and Fish shells.
It does not currently support Nushell.
