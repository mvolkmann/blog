## Overview

I purchased a used iMac G3 on April 30, 2025 for $200.
It chose this model because it is one of the newest Macintosh computers
that can run the HyperCard application.
I'm learning about HyperCard so I can attempt to recreate it as web application.

The specs for this computer can be found at {% aTargetBlank
"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac_dv_se_500.html",
"everymac.com" %}.
The highlights are:

- Apple iMac G3/500 DV SE (Summer 2000)
- Graphite color
- 15" CRT display
- native resolution 800x600
- 30 GB hard drive
- PC100 SDRAM 128 MB
- processor type PowerPC 750
- processor speed 500 MHz
- 4X DVD ROM slot loading
- Ethernet port
- 2 USB-A ports
- 2 Firewire 400 ports
- AirPort card for wireless internet using WEP
- original price $1499

This is one of the cleanest iMac G3 computers I was able to find,
as evidenced by the photos below.

## Setup

Below are the steps I took to setup this computer.
Many of the steps required downloading software from
either {% aTargetBlank "https://macintoshgarden.org", "Macintosh Garden" %} or
{% aTargetBlank "https://www.macintoshrepository.org", "Macintosh Repository" %}
onto a modern Mac.

- Reinstall the operating system to run Mac OS 9.0.1 instead of OS X
  using the provided CD "iMac Software Restore".
- Insert a 32GB USB stick into the iMac G3.
- Erase the USB stick and format it as "Macintosh ? Extended".
- Use the USB stick to copy software from a modern Mac to the iMac G3.
- Install "Aladdin Stuffit Expander" from a self-extracting archive.
- Install the "Mac OS 9.1 Updater".
- Install the "Mac OS 9.2.1 Updater".
- Install HyperCard 4.2.1.
- Install "The Haunted House 1.0.2" HyperCard stack.
