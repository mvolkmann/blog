## Overview

Workout Entry simplifies adding workouts to the Apple Health app.

While it is possible to manually add workouts in the Apple Health app,
it is a tedious process.

Describe your most common workout on the Settings screen.
Add a workout from the Workout screen.
If all the default values taken from the Settings screen
are correct for the workout being added,
tapping the "Add Workout" button is all that is required.
If any characteristics of the workout need to be modified,
provide new values for any of the following:
Workout Type, Date, Start Time, End Time, distance (for workouts that
include a distance such as Cycling, Hiking, Running, Swimming, and Walking),
and Calories Burned.
