## Overview

{% aTargetBlank "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit",
"HealthKit" %} is a library from Apple to
"Access and share health and fitness data
while maintaining the userâ€™s privacy and control."

It supports three categories of tasks:

1. collect and store health and fitness data
1. analyze and visualize the data
1. enable social interactions

"Because health data may contain sensitive, personal information,
apps must receive permission from the user to
read data from or write data to the HealthKit store."

## Flutter

The Flutter pub.dev package {% aTargetBlank
"https://pub.dev/packages/health", "health" %}
can access data from both Apple HealthKit and Android "Google Fit".

See my project flutter_health which is not yet working.

## Steps to Use

1. Create a new iOS App project in Xcode.
1. Click the top entry in the Navigator.
1. Select TARGETS ... Runner ... Info.
1. Hover over one the entries and click the "+" button to add one.
1. Add the key "Privacy - Health Share Usage Description"
1. Enter a value like "This app needs to access your health data."
1. Hover over one the entries and click the "+" button to add another.
1. Add the key "Privacy - Health Update Usage Description"
1. Enter a value like "This app needs to update your health data."
1. Click the target under "TARGETS" which has the same name as the app.
1. Click the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
1. Click "+ Capability".
1. Type "h" and double-click "HealthKit".

HealthKit cannot be used in the Simulator,
so the app must be run on a real device.
