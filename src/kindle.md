## Removing Books

When you are finished reading a book on the Kindle,
there are three options to consider that will
allow you to reread the book in the future.

1. Leave the book on the Kindle.

   It holds so many books that it will take a long time to fill it up.
   The Home screen can sort the books so the newest ones appear first.
   That way you don't have to look through the old ones
   when you're trying to find a book to read.

1. Copy the book to your computer and then delete it from the Kindle.

   You'll be able to copy them back to the Kindle
   if you every want to read them again.
   When you plug the Kindle into your computer
   you'll see that it contains a folder named "Documents".
   That's where the book files are located.
   They have names that end with `.azw` or `.mobi`.
   There are also .mbp files with the same beginning name.
   Those store the location within the book you were reading last,
   bookmarks and notes you've taken.

1. If you purchased a book from Amazon, just delete it from the Kindle.

   Amazon keeps a record of all your purchases
   and will allow you to download them from Amazon to your Kindle
   as many times as you want for free.

## Miscellaneous Tips

To delete a document, move the cursor to underline it,
push 5-way left and then in to confirm.

To play MineSweeper, press Home and alt-shift-M.

To force a page refresh, press alt-G.

To go to the Kindle Store quickly, press alt-Home.
