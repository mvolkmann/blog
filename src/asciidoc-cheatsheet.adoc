CAUTION: This is a caution admonition.

IMPORTANT: This is an important admonition.

NOTE: This is a note admonition.

TIP: This is a tip admonition.

WARNING: This is a warning admonition.

== Code Highlighting

Set the `:source-highlighter:` option.

[source, javascript]
----
function greet(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  return message;
}
----

== Headings

Precede headings with a number of equal signs
that indicates their level, as in  =, ==, ===, ...

By default the headings are not numbered.
To automatically number them, specify the `:sectnums` attribute
near the beginning of the document..

== Lists

For a bulleted lists, precede each item with * or -.
Alternate for each nested level.

* Fruit
  - Apple
  - Orange
* Meat
  - Beef
  - Chicken
  - Pork
* Vegetable
  - Corn
  - Tomato

Another option is to use multiple * characters to indicate the level.

* Level 1
** Level 2
*** Level 3

For ordered lists, 

. Item 1
.. Item 1.1
... Item 1.1.1
. Item 2
.. Item 2.1
. Item 3
.. Item 3.1

To explicitly specify each item "number",
enter them as they should be rendered.
The editor extension will provide warnings
if any are skipped or they are out of order.

A. Item 1
   1. Item 1.1
      a. Item 1.1.1
B. Item 2
   1. Item 2.1
C. Item 3

For definition lists, separate terms and definitions with ::.
By default, definitions will be indented on their own line
even if they aren't written that way.

Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2::
  Definition 2

For non-indented definition lists,
precede them with the "horizontal" attribute?

[horizontal]
Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2::
  Definition 2
