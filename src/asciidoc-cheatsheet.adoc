== Admonitions (Callouts)

There are four supported kinds of admonitions:
CAUTION, IMPORTANT, NOTE, TIP, and WARNING.
By default, each is preceded by its type.
To render icon instead, add the ":icons: font" document attribute
near the beginning of the document.

CAUTION: This is a caution admonition.

IMPORTANT: This is an important admonition.

NOTE: This is a note admonition.

TIP: This is a tip admonition.

WARNING: This is a warning admonition.

For an admonition with multiple paragraphs, use the syntax

[NOTE]
====
paragraph 1

paragraph 2

paragraph 3
====

Add a title to any admonition by preceding it with a line that
begins with a period and is followed by the title
with no space between the period and the first letter in the title.
For example:

.Don't do this!
WARNING: Rock climbing without ropes is dangerous.

== Author

Specify the author name and email address
as the first line after the level 1 header.
For example:

----
R. Mark Volkmann <r.mark.volkmann@gmail.com>
----

To insert the author name in the document, use `+{author}+`.
To insert the author email in the document, use `+{email}+`.
For example:

----
This document was written by {author}.
Contact the author at {email}.
----

== Block Quotes

[quote, Microsoft Haiku, late 1990's]
Out of memory.
We wish to hold the whole sky,
But we never will.

[quote, multiple paragraphs]
____
This is the first paragraph.

This is the second paragraph.
____

== Code

[source, javascript]
----
function greet(name) {
  const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  return message;
}
----

To add syntax highlighting to code blocks,
add the document attribute `:source-highlighter:`.
highlight.js

== Headings

Precede headings with a number of equal signs
that indicates their level, as in  =, ==, ===, ...

By default the headings are not numbered.
To automatically number them, specify the `:sectnums` attribute
near the beginning of the document..

== Images

To render an image, use the `image` macro.
This takes a relative file path to an image file.
Its attribute list can specify alt text,
a width in pixels, and a height in pixels.
If both a width and height are specified,
the aspect ratio can differ from that of the image.
So it's best to only specify one of those values.

When followed by two colons, it renders an image on its own line.

// Use default size.
image::assets/htmx-logo.png[htmx]
// Only specify a width.
image::assets/htmx-logo.png[htmx, 200]
// Only specify a height.
image::assets/htmx-logo.png[htmx, , 100]

An inline image uses the same syntax, except
only a single colon follows the `image` macro name.
The image image:assets/htmx-logo.png[htmx, 80] is inline.

To add figure numbers and a caption to an image,
add a line before the `image` macro that begins with a period
and is followed by the caption.  For example:

.htmx was created by Carson Gross.
image::assets/htmx-logo.png[htmx, 200]

== Lists

For a bulleted lists, precede each item with * or -.
Alternate for each nested level.

* Fruit
  - Apple
  - Orange
* Meat
  - Beef
  - Chicken
  - Pork
* Vegetable
  - Corn
  - Tomato

Another option is to use multiple * characters to indicate the level.

* Level 1
** Level 2
*** Level 3

For ordered lists, 

. Item 1
.. Item 1.1
... Item 1.1.1
. Item 2
.. Item 2.1
. Item 3
.. Item 3.1

To explicitly specify each item "number",
enter them as they should be rendered.
The editor extension will provide warnings
if any are skipped or they are out of order.

A. Item 1
   1. Item 1.1
      a. Item 1.1.1
B. Item 2
   1. Item 2.1
C. Item 3

For definition lists, separate terms and definitions with ::.
By default, definitions will be indented on their own line
even if they aren't written that way.

Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2::
  Definition 2

For non-indented definition lists,
precede them with the "horizontal" attribute?

[horizontal]
Term 1:: Definition 1
Term 2::
  Definition 2
