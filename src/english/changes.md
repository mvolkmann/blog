This page presents my thoughts on issues with the English language.

### Weird Punctuation

Instead of writing
<span class="bordered">
The title of the book is "Bad Rules."
</span>
&nbsp;write
<span class="bordered">
The title of the book is "Bad Rules".
</span>
&nbsp;Note the location of the period.
The rules of English say the period belongs inside the quotes. Why?
The title of the book doesn't contain a period in it
and what is inside the quotes should to be the title of the book.
Rebel! Don't follow this English rule!

### Wasteful Words

Write what you mean in as few words as possible.

Instead of writing
<span class="bordered">
Tell me whether <b>or not</b> you like cheese.
</span>,
just write
<span class="bordered">
Tell me whether you like cheese.
</span>
&nbsp;We all know there's a possibility you don't like cheese.
That's why we're asking.

Instead of writing
<span class="bordered">
The walls are two <b>different</b> colors.
</span>
&nbsp;write
<span class="bordered">
The walls are two colors.
</span>
&nbsp;Nobody will think it's possible you meant
the walls are two colors that are blue and blue.

Instead of writing
<span class="bordered">
The colors of apples, bananas, and grapes are
typically red, yellow, and green<b>, respectively</b>.
</span>
&nbsp;leave off
<span class="bordered">
, respectively
</span>
&nbsp;Who in their right mind would change the order?

### Gender

Using gender specific pronouns like "he" and "she" ruffles feathers
when there is no reason to specify a particular gender.
Many people try be politically correct by alternating between them.
English rules say you shouldn't use a generic word like "them" or "they".
I say do it anyway. Instead of writing
<span class="bordered">
When an employee is feeling angry,
tell <b>her</b> to take a walk around the building.
</span>,
write
<span class="bordered">
When an employee is feeling angry,
tell <b>them</b> to take a walk around the building.
</span>
