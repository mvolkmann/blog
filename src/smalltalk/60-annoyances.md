I currently find the following things about Smalltalk annoying.

- new windows open in random locations, not near where they were requested

- inconsistent case in method names

  For example, the `CharacterSequence` class defines
  the methods `subStrings` and `substringsSeparatedBy:`.

- inconsistent case in menu items

  For examples, see the Preferences and Windows submenus of the World menu.

- inconsistent case in button labels

  For example, in Debug windows the first row of buttons starting with "browse"
  have labels that are all lowercase.
  But the second row of buttons starting with "Proceed"
  have labels that are all capitalized.
