## Overview

When developing web applications it is useful to be able to
render a single component rather than run the entire app.
This is especially true when the component
does not appear on the first rendered page.
For example, suppose we are developing a shopping app with
the typical flow of login, add products to cart, and checkout.
During development a component that appears on the checkout page
it is tedious to have to retrace all of these steps
in order to test changes to the new component.

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) solves this! It provides a web UI where
a list of components in various states appear in the left nav.
Clicking one renders only that component in the main area where
we can interact with it in all the ways it supports.
It also provides a nice way to demo each component to stakeholders
and focus on the design and styling of each component.

## Storybook with Svelte

Storybook can be used with many web frameworks.
Let's dive into how it can be used with Svelte,
appropriate as I'm the author of the Manning book
{% aTargetBlank "https://www.manning.com/books/svelte-and-sapper-in-action",
"Svelte and Sapper in Action" %}.
Detailed instructions for using Storybook with Svelte components
can be found in the Storybook documentation at
{% aTargetBlank "https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-svelte/",
"Introduction to Storybook for Svelte" %}.

To add the use of Storybook to an existing Svelte application,
`cd` to the top application directory and enter `npx sb init`.
This takes a couple of minutes to complete
and results in the following changes:

- It installs all the development dependencies needed by Storybook.
- It adds the following npm scripts in `package.json`:

  ```json
  "storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006",
  "build-storybook": "build-storybook"
  ```

- It creates the `.storybook` directory, which
  contains the `main.js` file that configures Storybook.

- It creates the `src/stories` directory,
  which contains several example components and their stories.
  Note that typically source files for the components being demonstrated are
  found in the `src` directory rather than the `stories` directory.

To run Storybook locally, enter `npm run storybook`.

To add components to Storybook,
add one `.stories.js` file for each component
in the `stories` directory.
These files should be similar to the
provided `Button.stories.js` file.

Each story renders a component in a different state.
It is common for a `.stories.js` file to define multiple
stories that render the same component in different states.
Each state has a name that is displayed in the left nav
below the component name.
The states for the provided `Button` component
are "Primary", "Secondary", "Large", and "Small".

When new `.stories.js` files are created, refresh the browser
where Storybook is running to see them in the left nav.
When an existing `.stories.js` file is modified,
Storybook automatically detects the changes and
displays the modified story at the bottom of the left nav.

## Example Component and Stories

Letâ€™s create a new Svelte component and implement Storybook stories for it!
Start by entering the following commands to
create a new Svelte app and setup Storybook:

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template storybook-demo
cd storybook-demo
npm install
npx sb init
```

Add the file `src/Pie.svelte` containing the code below.
This component renders a progress indicator in the form of a pie chart.
It uses SVG to draw the pie and takes advantage of the
Svelte `tweened` function to animate changes to the value.

```html
<script>
  import {tweened} from 'svelte/motion';

  export let bgColor = 'tan';
  export let fgColor = 'blue';
  export let size = 50;
  export let value; // 0 to 100

  const store = tweened(value, {duration: 500});

  $: half = size / 2;
  $: viewBox = `0 0 ${size} ${size}`;
  $: circumference = 2 * Math.PI * half;

  let dashArray = '';

  $: {
    const v = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, value));
    store.set(v);
    const dash = ((v / 100) * circumference) / 2;
    dashArray = `${dash} ${circumference - dash}`;
  }
</script>

<svg height="{size}" width="{size}" {viewBox}>
  <circle class="bg" fill="{bgColor}" r="{half}" cx="{half}" cy="{half}" />
  <circle class="fg" r={half / 2} cx={half} cy={half} fill="transparent"
  stroke={fgColor} stroke-width={half} stroke-dasharray={dashArray} />
</svg>

<style>
  svg {
    transform: rotate(-90deg);
  }
</style>
```

Add the file `src/stories/Pie.stories.js` containing the following
which renders the `Pie` component with a default value of 30:

```js
import Pie from '../Pie.svelte';

export default {
  title: 'Pie',
  component: Pie,
  argTypes: {
    bgColor: {control: 'color'},
    fgColor: {control: 'color'},
    size: {control: 'number'},
    value: {control: 'range'}
  }
};

const Template = props => ({
  Component: Pie,
  props
});

export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = {value: 30};
```

Enter the command `npm run storybook`.
This starts the Storybook server and
opens the Storybook app in your default web browser.
Click the `Pie` component in the left nav which renders the following:

<img alt="Pie story" class="keep-size"
  src="/blog/assets/svelte-storybook-1.png?v={{pkg.version}}">

If desired, the example components can be deleted from the `src/stories`
so they no longer render.

To change any of the props passed to the `Pie` component,
click the "Docs" tab and enter new values using the UI shown below.
For example, drag the value slider value to change the value
rendered by the `Pie` component to any value from zero to 100.

<img alt="Pie story controls" class="keep-size"
  src="/blog/assets/svelte-storybook-2.png?v={{pkg.version}}">

## Static Deploy

Sometimes it is desirable to generate and deploy a static version
of Storybook, including all the registered components,
to allow others to view the components.
To do this, enter `npm run build-storybook`.
This creates the `storybook-static` directory
containing all the required HTML and JavaScript files.
This directory can be copied to any web server.
To view it locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Conclusion

Storybook provides a great way to
see a list of components used by an app,
demonstrate them in various states,
and to interact with them!
When a bug is discovered in a component,
it can be debugged in the context of Storybook,
which is typically faster than debugging in an app that uses it
because there is no need to navigate to where the component is used.
