## Overview

The number of component libraries for Svelte is growing!
This post provides an overview of some of the best options.

## Carbon Components Svelte

{% aTargetBlank "https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com",
"Carbon Components Svelte" %} is a library of UI components from IBM
that implement their {% aTargetBlank "https://www.carbondesignsystem.com",
"Carbon Design System" %}.

This library provides an extensive collection of components.
To my eye these all have a flat, plain look.

## Svelte Material UI

{% aTargetBlank "https://sveltematerialui.com/", "Svelte Material UI" %} (SMUI)
is a large library of Svelte components that implement Material UI.
It is implemented in TypeScript and uses Sass for style theme files.

For a list of supported components, click the link above
and see the list in the left nav.

The creator of SMUI, Hunter Perrin, created a great video
detailing how to get started using this library on
{% aTargetBlank "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyjZ7dezADw", "YouTube" %}.

For details on installing and using this library, see my post at
{% aTargetBlank "/blog/topics/#/blog/svelte/svelte-material-ui",
"Svelte Material UI" %}.

For an example of using this library, see my GitHub repository {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/mvolkmann/sveltekit-smui-demo", "sveltekit-smui-demo" %}.

## svelte-calendar

{% aTargetBlank "https://6edesign.github.io/svelte-calendar/",
"svelte-calendar" %} is a date picker component for Svelte.
It includes a large amount of animation.
For some users this may feel like too much animation
and be more of a distraction than a positive feature.
See the demo at the link above.

## svelte-datepicker

{% aTargetBlank "https://github.com/beyonk-adventures/svelte-datepicker",
"svelte-datepicker" %} from {% aTargetBlank "https://beyonk.com", "Beyonk" %}
is a component library that provides calendar, date picker,
date range picker, and time selection.

For an example, see this {% aTargetBlank
"https://svelte.dev/repl/d812e880c6934f9e9a7cf9f760eddc11?version=3.31.2",
"REPL" %}.

This renders a selected date range in a nice way,
but changing the start and end dates feels clumsy.

## svelte-fullcalendar

{% aTargetBlank "https://github.com/YogliB/svelte-fullcalendar",
"svelte-fullcalendar" %} is a Svelte wrapper around the framework independent
library {% aTargetBlank "https://fullcalendar.io", "FullCalendar" %}.
This is a very popular open source library that also has a paid tier
offering advanced features.

For an example of using this library, see my GitHub repository {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/mvolkmann/sveltekit-smui-demo", "sveltekit-smui-demo" %}.

## Svelte MultiSelect

{% aTargetBlank "https://svelte-multiselect.netlify.app",
"Svelte MultiSelect" %} is an input component that displays a dropdown list
of options from which the user can make multiple selections.
Each selected option is displayed as a "chip"
with an "x" that can be clicked to deselect it.

For an example of using this component, see my GitHub repository {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/mvolkmann/sveltekit-smui-demo", "sveltekit-smui-demo" %}.

## svelte-time-picker
