The article I wrote on Svelte for Object Computing (OCI)
can be found {% aTargetBlank
"https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/july-2019-web-dev-simplified-with-svelte",
"here" %}.
This article served as the starting point for my book {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.manning.com/books/svelte-and-sapper-in-action",
"Svelte and Sapper in Action" %}.

The errata for my book is [here](/blog/svelte-and-sapper-in-action/errata/).
