## Overview

{% aTargetBlank "https://nextjs.org", "Next.js" %}
is a full-stack web framework built on React.

Next.js uses {% aTargetBlank "https://turbo.build/pack", "Turbopack" %}
rather than Vite as its module bundler.
Turbopack bills itself as the "Rust-powered successor to Webpack".
It claims to be 10 times faster than Vite and 700 times faster than Webpack.

## Page Routes

Source files for page-specific components can be added in the same directory.
