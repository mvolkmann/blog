These are my notes on chess strategies.
I am not a highly rated chess player, so these are just
guidelines that beginner to intermediate players might find useful.

## Strategies

1. Attempt to control the center of the board.

   The board below shows some ideal positions for pieces that have been
   developed to control the center of the board.
   Of course your opponent will likely not allow you to move to these positions
   but it is a good goal.

1. Look for potential attacks from opponent, especially ones that
   put you in check AND threaten other pieces.
1. Count the number of pieces attacking and defending each square
   and consider the values of the pieces that would be exchanged.
1. When planning the next move, verify that it isn't
   weakening the defense of your pieces.
1. Avoid blocking your own pieces, especially behind pawns.
1. Avoid pawn attacks that result to multiple pawns in the same file.
1. Avoid placing knights on the edge of the board
   because that leaves them with fewer target squares.
1. Having two bishops and no knights is typically slightly better (half point?)
   than having only two knights or having only one bishop and one knight.
1. Plan and defend against forks.
1. Plan and defend against skewers.
1. Plan and defend against discovered attacks.
1. Avoid moving the same piece twice because it loses a tempo (turn).
1. Usually avoid moving backwards.
1. Try to be more aggressive (attacking or forcing a response)
   than passive (defending).
1. Don't swap pieces if no advantage is gained, i.e. don't
   trade a piece with a good position for a piece with a lesser position.
1. Utilized the king in the end game, especially to protect pawns.
1. Utilize "head on a stick" moves where a piece is
   defended by a pawn that is one rank behind it.
1. Sometimes it is good to take a piece that is protected because
   if they take back they expose a more valuable piece.
