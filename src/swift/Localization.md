## Overview

There many facets to localization including
text translation, enabling users to select a locale within an app,
plural forms, numbers, currency, dates, and images.
Each of these are discussed here.

Many SwiftUI views automatically perform translations.
These include `Text`, `Label`, and `Button`.

## Specifying Supported Languages

1. Select the top entry in the Project Navigator.
1. In the left nav of the project editor, select the project.
1. Select the "Info" tab.
1. In the "Localization" section there will already be an entry for "English".
   For each additional language to be supported,
   click the "+" Button and select a language.

## Creating a "Strings" File

Translations are described in a "Strings" file.
To create one:

1. Add a file to the project by pressing cmd-n.
1. In the Resource section, select the "Strings File" template.
1. Click the "Next" button.
1. Keep the default directory and the default file name "Localizable.strings".
1. Click the "Create" button.
1. Select the "Localizable.strings" file in the Project Navigator.
1. Open the Inspector panel on the right.
1. Under "Localization", click the "Localize..." button.
1. In the dialog that appears, click the "Localize" button.
1. Once again, select the "Localizable.strings" file in the Project Navigator.
1. In the Inspector panel on the right under "Localization",
   check all the language checkboxes.
   This will add one entry under "Localizable.strings"
   in the Project Navigator for each selected language.

## Populating the "Strings" File

1. In the Project Navigator, expand the "Localizable.strings" entry
   to expose an entry for each supported language.
1. For each supported language

   1. Select its entry in the Project Navigator.
   1. For each string to be translated

      1. Enter an assignment statement of the form `"key" = "translation";`

         **Note the semicolon at the end.**

For example, the key could be "greeting",
the English translation could be "Hello",
and the French translation could be "Bonjour".

When no translation is found for a given key in the current language,
the key itself is used.

If a key is the same as its English translation then it is
not necessary to add an entry for it in the English file.
For example, if the key is "Hello" then
there is no need to add `"Hello" = "Hello";"` in the English file
and the French file could contain `"Hello" = "Bonjour";`.
This is the recommend approach unless the English translation is long.

Translation strings can contain Markdown syntax.
For example, this can be used to make some of the text
bold, italic, or underlined.

## Preview Locale

To select a locale to use in the Preview,
apply the `environment` view modifier to the top-most view.
For example:

```swift
ContentView()
    .environment(\.locale, .init(identifier: "la"))
```

where `la` is replaced by a language abbreviation such as `en` for English
or a combination of a language and region abbreviation such as `en-US`.

## Simulator and Device Locale

To select a locale in the Simulator or on a device:

- Open the Settings app.
- Select General.
- If the desired language is not displayed under "PREFERRED LANGUAGES",
  tap "Add Language...", select the language,
  and tap one of the "Use {language}" buttons
  to specify which language should be active now.
- Drag the language to be used now to the top of the list of languages
  using the drag handles to right of each language name.
- Tap the "Continue" button.
- Return to the app being tested.

## User-selected Locale

The `environment` view modifier can be used to
allow the user to select a locale within the app.

This {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/13155?answerId=36704022#36704022",
"Apple Forums post" %} says the following:

> If the system puts up a UI component on your behalf it will do so
> in the localization that it thinks that your app is running in.
> If your app is 'pretending' to run in some other language,
> you'll end up with a mixed localization, where some parts of your app
> (the parts you control) are in one language and other parts of your app
> (the parts controlled by the OS) are in another.
> That's a very poor user experience.

Despite this warning, the `environment` view modifier
can be used to change the current locale.
For example:

```swift
        VStack {
            Picker("Locale", selection: $language) {
                Text("English in U.S.").tag("en-US")
                Text("French in France").tag("fr-FR")
                Text("Spanish in Spain").tag("es-ES")
            }
            .pickerStyle(.segmented)

            Text("Hello!")
        }
        .padding()
        .environment(\.locale, .init(identifier: language))
```

Changing the locale in this way rather than in the Settings app
works for many kinds of translations, but not all.

Either of the following approaches can be used to get a translation in code:

```swift
let translation = Bundle.main.localizedString(
    forKey: key,
    value: key, // translation defaults to the key
    table: nil // defaults to "Localizable"
               // which uses the file Localizable.strings
)

// This is a shortcut for the above where table is nil
// which causes it to use `Localizable` for the table.
let translation = NSLocalizedString(key, comment: "")
```

These approaches get a translation based on
the locale selected in the Settings app.
However, neither of these honor the locale specified with
the environment view modifier.

The same issue exists with retrieving localized images from an "Image Set".
TODO: Is this a bug in SwiftUI?

## Localized String Arguments

Localized strings can specify arguments accepted and
where they should be inserted in translations.
Arguments are represented by `%@` for string values and `%d` for numeric values.
Arguments are passed to the `LocalizedStringKey` initializer
using string interpolation.

For example, the following translations can be defined:

```text
// English
"Annie %@ %@" = "The %@ will come out %@.";

// French
"Annie %@ %@" = "Le %@ sortira %@.";
"sun" = "soleil";
"tomorrow" = "demain";

// Spanish
"Annie %@ %@" = "El %@ saldra %@.";
"sun" = "sol";
"tomorrow" = "ma√±ana";
```

The following code uses these translations:

```swift
let thing = "sun"
let time = "tomorrow"
Text("Annie \(sun) \(tomorrow)")
```

TODO: How can we translate the strings "sun" and "tomorrow"?

## Plurals

SwiftUI can automate displaying phrases that describe a number of things
where the word that describes the thing varies based on the count.
For example, "dog" vs. "dogs" or "cactus" vs. "cacti".

There are two kinds of plural values to consider.
Cardinal numbers specify a count or quantity (ex. two).
Ordinal numbers specify a position within an ordered list (ex. second).

Pluralization of cardinal numbers is supported by a `.stringsdict` file
which is described in this section.
Pluralization of ordinal numbers is supported by `NumberFormatter`
as described in the [Numbers and Currency](#numbers-and-currency) section.

To define how specific words should be pluralized based on a count:

1. Add a file to the project by pressing cmd-n.
1. In the Resource section, select the "Stringsdict File" template.
1. Click the "Next" button.
1. Keep the default directory and the default file name
   "Localizable.stringsdict".
1. Click the "Create" button.
1. To support multiple languages:
   1. Select the "Localizable.stringsdict" file in the Project Navigator.
   1. Open the Inspector panel on the right.
   1. Under "Localization", click the "Localize..." button.
   1. In the dialog that appears, click the "Localize" button.
   1. Once again, select the "Localizable.stringsdict" file
      in the Project Navigator.
   1. In the Inspector panel on the right under "Localization",
      check all the language checkboxes.
      This will add one entry under "Localizable.stringsdict"
      in the Project Navigator for each selected language.
1. For each supported language:
   1. Select its entry in the Project Navigator.
   1. Add rows with keys, types, and values similar to what is
      shown in the screenshot below for each phrase to be pluralized.
      A row and all its descendant rows can be copied
      from one language entry to another to save typing.

</figure>

The supported format specifiers include:

- `%d` - signed integer
- `%u` - unsigned integer
- `%lld` - long long decimal (`Int64`)
- `%f` - double

`%lld` works for `Int` values, but it seems the `%d` and `%u` do not!

The following keys are used to define how counts should be pluralized.
Their meaning differs based on the locale,
especially the meaning of "few" and "many".

| Key     | English Meaning         |
| ------- | ----------------------- |
| `zero`  | 0                       |
| `one`   | 1                       |
| `two`   | 2                       |
| `few`   | 3                       |
| `many`  | > 3                     |
| `other` | any value not specified |

Many languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish
only use `zero`, `one`, and `other`.
Chinese and Japanese only use one form.
Arabic uses all six forms.

For more details see the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)
{% aTargetBlank "https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules",
"Plural Rules" %} and {% aTargetBlank
"https://unicode-org.github.io/cldr-staging/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html",
"Language Plural Rules" %}.

The following code demonstrates displaying a number of apples.
The string to be formatted must contain one string interpolation.
The count can be hard-coded in the interpolation
or provided by a variable.

```swift
Text("apple \(2)") // a pair of apples
let appleCount = 7
Text("apple \(appleCount)") // 7 apples
```

## Numbers and Currency

The {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/numberformatter",
"NumberFormatter" %} class will localize date formats
when its `locale` property is set.

Currency formatting requires the locale identifier
to contain both a language code and a country code.

The following code demonstrates all the supported number formatting styles:

```swift
let number = NSNumber(value: 1234.5678)
let formatter = NumberFormatter()

func demo(_ style: NumberFormatter.Style) {
    formatter.numberStyle = style
    formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "en-US") // English U.S.
    print(formatter.string(from: number) ?? "invalid")
    formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "fr-FR") // French France
    print(formatter.string(from: number) ?? "invalid")
}

demo(.none)
// 1235
// 1235

demo(.decimal)
// 1,234.568
// 1‚ÄØ234,568

demo(.percent)
// 123,457%
// 123‚ÄØ457¬†%

demo(.scientific)
// 1.2345678E3
// 1,2345678E3

demo(.spellOut)
// one thousand two hundred thirty-four point five six seven eight
// mille deux cent trente-quatre virgule cinq six sept huit

demo(.ordinal)
// 1,235th
// 1‚ÄØ235e

demo(.currency)
// $1,234.57
// 1‚ÄØ234,57¬†‚Ç¨

// From the Apple documentation,
// "This style behaves like the .currency style,
// except that negative numbers representations are
// surrounded by parentheses rather than preceded by a negative symbol.
demo(.currencyAccounting)
// $1,234.57
// 1‚ÄØ234,57¬†‚Ç¨

demo(.currencyPlural)
// 1,234.57 US dollars
// 1‚ÄØ234,57 euros
```

## Dates

The {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/dateformatter",
"DateFormatter" %} class will localize date formats
when its `locale` property is set.
This works with predefined date/time styles
and also with custom date/time templates.
For example:

```swift
let date = Date()
let formatter = DateFormatter()

formatter.dateStyle = .short
formatter.timeStyle = .short
formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "en") // English
print(formatter.string(from: date)) // 1/3/23, 1:36 PM

formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "fr") // French
print(formatter.string(from: date)) //                 Text("apple \(0)")
                Text("apple \(1)")
                Text("apple \(2)")
                Text("apple \(3)")
                Text("apple \(4)")
                let appleCount = 7
                Text("apple \(appleCount)")
3/01/2023 13:36

formatter.setLocalizedDateFormatFromTemplate("dd MMMM")
formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "en") // English
print(formatter.string(from: date)) // 03 January

formatter.locale = Locale(identifier: "fr") // French
print(formatter.string(from: date)) // 03 janvier
```

## Images

To render a localized image where
a different image is displayed for each supported language:

1. Add an "Image Set" to the `Assets.xcassets` file.
1. Open the Inspector pane on the right side.
1. Click the last tab which shows the "Attributes Inspector".
1. In the "Localizations" section, check all the languages to be supported.
   This opens a separate area in the image editor panel
   for each language where 1x, 2x, and 3x images can be added.
1. Add at least one image size for each language.
1. Render the image by passing the image set name to the `Image` view
   in the same way as for any other image.

The following code assumes that an Image Set named "landmark"
was created in the `Assets.xcassets` file and it
contains different images for English, French, and Spanish.

```swift
Image("landmark")
    .resizable()
    .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
    .frame(height: 150)
    .id(locale) // This does not help!
```

The image changes when the user changes the region
specified in the Settings app. For the steps to do this, see
[## Simulator and Device Locale](#simulator-and-device-locale).

If the locale is changed within the app using the
`environment` view modifier, localized images do not update.
Perhaps this is a SwiftUI bug.

Another approach that does work is to create a separate Image Set
for each supported locale.
The following code assumes that Image Sets named
"landmark-en-US", "landmark-fr-FR", and "landmark-es-ES"
were created in the `Assets.xcassets` file.
It does update when the value of the `locale` variable changes.

```swift
Image("landmark-" + locale)
    .resizable()
    .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
    .frame(height: 150)
```

## Device Testing

To change the default language on an iOS device:

1. Open the Settings app.
1. Tap "General".
1. Tap "Language & Region".
1. To add a language to the list of "PREFERRED LANGUAGES":
   1. Tap "Add Language..."
   1. Tap a language in the list.
   1. Tap a button to either use that language now or continue using the current language.
1. To change the current language, drag it to the top of the list
   using the drag handles on the trailing edge of the list rows.
1. To delete a language, swipe its row to the left,
   tap the "Delete" button, and tap the "Continue" button.

It can be important to also select a specific region.
For example, an iOS device in the United States will typically have
the language set to "English" and the region set to "United States".
If the language is changed to "Fran√ßais",
but the region remains set to "United States"
then dates will not be formatted in the expected way for French.
Changing the region to "France" corrects this.

To also change the default region on an iOS device:

1. Tap "Region"
1. Tap the name of a region.
1. Tap the "Change to {region-name}" button.

## Exporting and Importing Localizations

Localization strings can be exported to a file that can be
sent to a localization expert that will supply translations.
Once the file is returned, it can be imported into the project.

To export the localizations:

- Select Product ... Export Localizations...
- Select the directory where a new directory will be created
  (defaults to the project directory).
- Enter a name for the new directory
  (defaults to "{project-name} Localizations").
- Click the "Export" button.

The new directory will contain one `.xcloc` directory
for each supported language.
These directories will contain several subdirectories and files.
The translations can be found in the `.xliff` file
found in the "Localized Contents" subdirectory.
This is an XML file that contains one `trans-unit` element for each translation.
These elements contain the child elements `source`, `target`, and `comment`.
People with language translation experience can edit these files,
modifying the `target` and `comment` element contents.

To import modified localizations:

- Select Product ... Import Localizations...
- Select a `.xcloc` file for a specific language.
- Click the "Import" button.
- Differences between the current translations and the
  translations to be imported will be displayed side-by-side.
  No editing can be performed here.
- If the differences are acceptable, click the "Import" button.
  The changes will be merged into the Strings File
  which by default is named `Localizable.strings`.
  However, it seems that modified comments are not merged.
