## Overview

{% aTargetBlank "https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/", "SwiftUI" %}
is a Swift library for building macOS, iOS, and Apple Watch apps.
It is an alternative to its predecessor UIKit.

By comparison SwiftUI ...

- is currently missing some features of UIKit
  (but UIKit can be used within SwiftUI apps)
- is declarative in nature than imperative
- emphasizes use of structs over classes (UIKit uses classes)
- requires far less code to do the same things
- only runs on iOS 13 and above
- doesn't use Storyboard to build views
- doesn't use `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`
  (read about these {% aTargetBlank
  "https://learnappmaking.com/scene-delegate-app-delegate-xcode-11-ios-13/",
  "here" %})

## Getting Started

- open Xcode which includes Swift and SwiftUI
- select "Create a new Xcode project"
- select an Application type such as "App" and click "Next"
- enter a Product Name
- select a Team such as "your name (Personal Team)"
- enter an Organization Identifier such as your email address
- select the Interface such as "SwiftUI"
- select the Language such as "Swift"
- check "Use Core Data" to persist data in a local database
- check "Include Tests" to enable writing unit tests
- click "Next"
- select the directory where the project will be stored and click "Create"

To change the device being simulated,
click the device drop-down after the app name near the top
and select the device type (such as "iPhone 13").

Press the black, right-pointing triangle near the top
to build and run the initial version of the app in the simulator.

To change the target version of iOS,
click the app name at the top of the Navigator,
click the "General" tab, and
select an iOS version from the dropdown in the "Deployment info" section.

A new "App" project begins with the following files.

- `{app-name}.swift`

  This defines the main struct which implements the `App` protocol.
  It has computed property named `body`
  whose value implements the `Scene` protocol.
  The actual value is an instance of `WindowGroup`.
  This renders an instance of `ContentView` which is defined in the next file.
  Apps for macOS and iPadOS can specify more than one window
  in the `WindowGroup`, but iOS and watchOS apps cannot.
  iOS will render all the windows as if they were in a `VStack`.

- `ContentView.swift`

  This defines the `ContentView` struct which implements the `View` protocol
  and is the top of the user interface.
  It also defines the `ContentView_Previews` struct
  which describes the Previews that should display in the Canvas area.
  This can be one or more views that are each displayed in a separate Preview.

- `Assets.xcassets`

  This associates names with assets such as images, audio files, and video files.

- `{app-name}.xcodeproj`

  This file is not visible in the Navigator,
  but can be viewed and edited by clicking the top entry in the navigator.
  The editor for this data has the following tabs:
  General, Signing & Capabilities, Resource Tags, Info,
  Build Settings, Build Phases, and Build Rules.
  The General tab configures the app display name, version of iOS,
  targets (iPhone, iPad, or Mac), status bar style, and more.

To add a particular kind of provided UI View in a `.swift` file,
manually enter code or click where it should go in the code
and click the "+" in the upper-right of the Code Editor.
Clicking the "+" displays the Object Library dialog
that contains a list provided view types.
Selecting one displays related documentation and code examples.
Double-click a view type to insert code for it at the cursor
or drag a view type to the desired code location.

### Canvas / Preview

The Canvas area displays Previews of the UI running outside of a simulator.
To hide/show the Canvas area, select Editor ... Canvas
or press cmd-option-return.
If Preview isn't running inside the Canvas area,
press the "Resume" button at the top to start it
or press cmd-option-p.

By default a preview of the view is only displayed
when the file that defines it is selected in the Navigator.
To keep the preview of a specific view in the Canvas area
even when a different file is selected,
select its source file in the Navigator and
click the pin icon in the lower-left of the Canvas.

When code changes are saved and there are no errors,
the Preview is automatically updated.
When there are errors, the Preview pauses and must be manually restarted
by click the "Resume" button or pressing cmd-option-p.

If the Canvas area displays the message "Failed to build" in the upper-left,
click the "Diagnostics" button in the upper-right to see error messages.

Typically views are added to the `body` of the currently selected source file
by typing code into the editor pane.
Another way to do this is to:

- Open the Preview.
- Open the Library (press cmd-shift-l).
- Select the "Show the Views Library" tab.
- Drag a view over the Preview without dropping it.
- Note the popup below the Preview that indicates how it will be added.
- Drop the view onto the Preview.
- Configure the view in the Inspector on the right.

To zoom in and out on the Preview area,
click the magnifier glass icons in the lower right (minus and plus)
or select a zoom level from the percent dropdown.

By default the Preview is not in "Live Preview" mode.
Key things to know about not being in this mode include:

- Clicking a View in the Preview selects it rather than triggering tap events.
  The corresponding code is highlighted and
  the Inspector changes to show the properties of the selected View.
- Double-clicking a View in the Preview is similar,
  but moves focus to the code so it can be edited.
- Clicking a View in the code selects the corresponding View in the Preview
  and also populates the Inspector.
- Changes made in the Inspector update the Preview and the code,
  but they do not take effect until
  focus is moved out of the modified Navigator field.
  This is a great way to learn about supported view modifiers and their syntax.

To switch to "Live Preview" mode so tap events are honored,
click the button with a triangle inside a circle.
This also enables scrolling by dragging
which is not possible in the default mode.
Clicking this also triggers the Preview to resume if it is paused
and rebuild the code.

Output from `print` calls does not appear in the Debug area
when interacting with a preview.

To rotate the display to landscape mode,
click the button above the display that contains
a square with a curved arrow on its upper-left corner.
This only works when not in "Live Preview" mode.
The same button appears in the Simulator.

It is possible for the Preview area to show more than one preview.
This is controlled by the `ContentView_Previews` struct
defined in `ContentView.swift`.
For example, the following renders
`ContentView` in portrait orientation and light mode,
`ContentView` in landscape orientation and dark mode.

```swift
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
            .previewInterfaceOrientation(.portrait)
            .preferredColorScheme(.light)
        ContentView()
            .previewInterfaceOrientation(.landscapeLeft)
            .preferredColorScheme(.dark)
    }
}
```

Note that if any of the previews are in "Live Preview" mode,
only that preview will be displayed.
Exit out of that mode to get the other previews to display again.

To reduce the size of previews to only show their content
and not the surrounding device chrome,
call `.previewLayout(.sizeThatFits)`.

### Inspector

The Inspector shows commonly used modifiers of the selected view.
To see additional modifiers,
click "Add Modifier" at the button of the Inspector.
Optionally type part of a modifier name to filter the list.
Click a modifier to add it to the Inspector.
To stop displaying a modifier in the Inspector,
hover over it and click the "Delete" button that appears.

### Simulator

When developing iOS, watchOS, and macOS apps, it is useful to
launch the app in the Simulator app directly from Xcode.
Preview and the Simulator can simulate many different devices.

To run the app in the Simulator, click the triangle at the top
or press cmd-r while focus is in Xcode (not in the Simulator).
This builds the app, launches the Simulator (if not already running),
loads the app in the Simulator, and starts it.

Unlike in Previews, the app is not automatically updated
when code changes are saved.
Click the triangle or press cmd-r again
to repeat the entire build/load/start process.

If there are errors or warnings, the number of each will be displayed
on the right side of the code editor header.
Click either number to display the messages in the "Issue Navigator".

Preview is more limited in functionality than the Simulator.
TODO: List the differences between the Simulator app and the Preview pane.

The default device type used by the Simulator can be changed
by selecting Product ... Destination ... Choose Destination...
and selecting a device type.
This must be done in each Xcode project.

There are known rendering issues with the "iPhone 12 mini" simulator,
so choose a different device for now.

The Simulator supports many useful keyboard shortcuts.

| Action                                        | Menu Item                                         | Keyboard Shortcut |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| change orientation                            | Device ... Rotate {Left \| Right}                 | cmd-◀ and cmd-▶   |
| toggle use of computer keyboard to enter text | IO ... Keyboard ... Connect Hardware ... Keyboard | cmd-shift-k       |
| switch between light and dark mode            | Features ... Toggle Appearance                    | cmd-shift-a       |
| copy screen to clipboard                      | Edit ... Copy Screen                              | cmd-ctrl-c        |
| save screen shot as .png file                 | File ... Save Screen                              | cmd-s             |
| save session video as .mp4 file               | File ... Record Screen                            | cmd-r             |
| simulate use of Face ID                       | Features ... Face ID ... option                   | rarely used       |
| show home screen                              | Device ... Home                                   | cmd-shift-h       |
| show app switcher (to switch or quit apps)    | Device ... App Switcher                           | cmd-ctrl-shift-h  |

Screenshot file names begin with "Simulator Screen Shot" followed by
the device name, date, and time.
They are saved in the Desktop directory.
These screenshots are useful for uploading to
`https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/` when submitting an app to the App Store.

When finished recording a session video,
click the stop button at the top of the simulator.
Right-click on the video thumbnail that appears
and select the directory where it should be saved.

Screen recording file names begins with "Simulator Screen Recording" followed
by the device name, date, and time will be saved in the selected location.
Double-click the file to play it in the "QuickTime Player" app.
These are useful for demos and to share with designers and clients
to discuss app features.

Face ID options include Enrolled (approves use of Face ID),
Matching Face (simulates a match),
and Non-Matching Face (simulates failure to match).

To erase all data and settings,
select Device ... Erase All Content and Settings...
This can be useful to run an app without having any data cached
from previous runs, such as authentication details.

There are many more features in the Simulator menus.

## Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)

Apple documents guidelines for building user interfaces at {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/",
"Human Interface Guidelines" %}.
This includes recommendations for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS
user interfaces.

The guidelines for iOS are divided into several categories,
three of which are Bars, Views, and Controls.
The following summarizes what is found in those sections
and how the described components map to SwiftUI views.

## SF Symbols

SF Symbols is a macOS app from Apple that provides over 4,000 icons.
These can be rendered in custom app using the `Image` view
with the `systemName` argument.

Some symbols support multiple rendering modes
that enable using different colors for parts of the icon.
To see the available rendering modes for a given icon,
select the icon and click the paint brush tab in the Inspector on the right.
Each icon has a preferred rendering mode,
but a different rendering mode can be selected.

The rendering modes include:

- Monochrome - single color; seems the same as hierarchical
- Hierarchical - single color with multiple opacity levels
- Palette - two or three colors
- Multicolor - seems the same as hierarchical
- Automatic - preferred rendering mode of the icon of is used;
  corresponds to not specifying a mode, not a real mode

Icons that support variable colors are grouped in the "Variable" category.
These display additional parts of the icon as a percentage value increases.
To see this in action:

- Select one of the icons in the "Variable category.
- Select the paint brush tab in the Inspector on the right.
- Select any rendering mode.
- Activate variable color mode by clicking the
  button to the left of the percentage slider.
- Drag the slider to change the percentage value.
- Note that all the displayed icons update to show the effect.

Here's an example of using such an icon:

```swift
@State private var percent = 0.0
...
Image(systemName: "cellularbars", variableValue: percent)
Button("Decrease") {
    if percent > 0 { percent -= 0.1 }
}
Button("Increase") {
    if percent < 1 { percent += 0.1 }
}
```

See the {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/mvolkmann/SFSymbolsDemo/tree/main", "SFSymbolsDemo" %}
app in GitHub.

### Bars

    "Navigation Bar" %}

  - appears at top of screen below status bar
  - enables navigation through hierarchical screens
  - provides a leading back button
  - can have trailing buttons like "Edit" and "Done"
  - can have a tint color
  - can have an inline or large title
  - can use a "Segmented Control" in place of title
  - SwiftUI creates this with `NavigationView`

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/search-bars/",
    "Search Bar" %}

  - a text input for entering search text
  - has magnifier glass icon
  - can display in a Navigation Bar
  - can include clear and confirm buttons

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/sidebars/",
    "Sidebar" %}

  - provides app-level navigation to top-level collections of content
  - for example, the Mail app displays a list of mailboxes in a sidebar
  - selecting an item in the sidebar changes what is displayed
    in the pane that follows
  - SwiftUI creates this by applying the `.listStyle(.sidebar)` view modifier
    to a `List` view. See an example in the "Sidebar" section.

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/status-bars/",
    "Status Bar" %}

  - appears at top of screen above Navigation Bar
  - the system provided Status Bar displays the time on the left and indicators
    for cell strength, WiFi strength, and battery remaining on the right
  - can style to light or dark mode and customize colors
  - should not replace with a custom status bar
  - can temporarily hide it, but should never permanently hide it
  - to hide the system status bar, apply the `.statusBar(hidden: true)`
    view modifier to the top `NavigationView`
  - SwiftUI needs nothing to support this because the system provides it

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/alerts/",
    "Alert" %}

  - a modal dialog with a title, optional message,
    one or more buttons, and optional input text fields
  - avoid having more than two buttons
  - minimize usage to important situations
  - SwiftUI creates this with the `alert` view modifier
    that can be called on any kind of view.
    See the "Alerts" section.

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/collections/",
    "Collection" %}

  - manages an ordered set of content,
    like photos presented as a grid of thumbnails
  - tap an item to select
  - touch and hold an item to edit
  - swipe to scroll
  - SwiftUI creates this with what?
    TODO: Is this supported in SwiftUI? Maybe UIKit is required.

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/image-views/",
    "Image View" %}

  - displays a single image or an animated sequence
  - can fill the entire display
  - SwiftUI creates this with `Image`

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/pages/",
    "Page" %}

  - implements linear navigation between a set of related pages
    using either scrolling or page curl effects
  - SwiftUI provides this in `TabView` when it has a
    `tabViewStyle` view modifier with a value of `.page`.
    See an example in the `TabView` section.

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/popovers/",
    "Popover" %}

  - a modal or non-modal dialog displayed in response to
    tapping a control or tapping in an area
  - typically renders a "tail" pointing to what triggered it

  - top corners are rounded and can customize the radius
  - there are two available heights, large (default) and medium
  - modal by default
  - SwiftUI creates this with the `sheet` view modifier.
    See an example in the "Modal Dialogs" section.

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/split-views/",
    "Split View" %}

  - presents hierarchical data with two or three columns:
    primary, supplementary, and content
  - selections in primary cause changes in supplementary
  - selections in supplementary cause changes in content
  - highlights current selections
  - used in Mail app where primary is a list of mailboxes,
    supplementary is a list of messages in the selected mailbox,
    and content is the content of the selected email
  - SwiftUI doesn't directly support this, but
    similar functionality can be implemented using `NavigationView`.
    This displays side-by-side views on iPads in landscape mode.

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/tables/",
    "Table" %}

  - a scrolling, single-column of rows that are each divided into sections
  - can use for navigation in a Split View
  - three styles: plain, grouped, and inset grouped
  - not a data grid like in other UI frameworks
  - SwiftUI uses the `List` view in place of the UIKit `UITableView` view.
    `List` is easier to use.
    It doesn't require specifying the number of rows,
    and cells don't need to be configured.
    Instead a `List` is composed of rows that each
    know how to arrange and display their data.
    See the "List" section.

    "UIKeyboardType enum" %}
  - SwiftUI creates this with a combination of `Text` and `AttributedString`.
    See the `AttributedString` section.

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/views/web-views/",
    "Web View" %}

  - renders embedded HTML or HTML from a web site
  - can enable forward and backward navigation
  - SwiftUI does not include support for web views.
    `WKWebView` can be used, but setting it up in SwiftUI app is not trivial.

### Controls

- {% aTargetBlank
    "https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/buttons/",
    "Button" %}

  - several predefined button styles are supported including
    - toggle: different from `Toggle` view

  - single-line text input with fixed height
  - usually has rounded corners
  - brings up on-screen keyboard when tapped
  - can contain placeholder text which is preferred over preceding with a label
  - optionally includes a clear button (x in a circle)
  - can mask inputs like passwords
  - can include images on leading and/or trailing sides
  - can specify a keyboard type defined by the {% aTargetBlank

    "UIKeyboardType enum" %}
  - SwiftUI creates this with `TextField`, `SecureField`,
    and `TextEditor` (multi-line)

## Icons

{% aTargetBlank "https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/", "SF Symbols" %}
is a library of over 4000 icons provided by Apple.
To use it, browse the website linked above and click the "Download" link.
This downloads a `.dmg` file.
Double-click this and double-click the `.pkg` file icon to install
the library and the "SF Symbols" app.
To discover icon names, launch the "SF Symbols" app,
browse the collection of icons, and click them.

To use an icon in a SwiftUI app, add an `Image` view. For example:

```swift
Image(systemName: "heart").font(.largeTitle)) // one way to set font size
Image(systemName: "cloud.snow").font(.system(size: 64)) // another way
```

The size, weight, and color of an SF Symbols icon
can be specified using the same view modifiers
as are used to style `Text` views.

Some SF Symbols do not have a 1-1 aspect ratio,
so using the `frame` modifier with the same values for `width` and `height`
can skew them.

Some SF Symbols support multiple colors and optional parts.
For example:

```swift

```

To use FontAwesome icons,
select File ... Add Packages...
and enter the URL https://github.com/onmyway133/FontAwesomeSwiftUI
in the search input in the upper-right.
Select FontAwesomeSwiftUI and press the "Add Package" button.

To render a FontAwesome icon, call `FontAwesome.register()`
and pass icons to the `Text` view.
For example, `Text(AwesomeIcon.aws.rawValue)`.

## Core Graphics (CG)

Several types used in views have names that begin with "CG"
which stands for "Core Graphics". These include:

- `CGAffineTransform`

  This holds a transformation matrix used in 2D transformations.

- `CGColor`

  `CGColor` is a type used by Core Graphics to represent colors.
  It is typically only used to apply color operations in
  Core Graphics contexts like CGImage and CGLayer.

- `CGFloat`

  This holds a floating point value whose size depends on the CPU architecture.
  It can be 32 or 64 bits.

- `CGPoint`

  This holds `x` and `y` properties that have `CGFloat` values.

- `CGRect`

  This holds an `origin` property that is a `CGPoint`
  and a `size` property that is a `CGSize`.
  It also has the following computed properties with `CGFloat` values:
  `height`, `width`, `minX`, `maxX`, `minY`, `maxY`, `midX`, and `midY`.

- `CGSize`

  This holds `width` and `height` properties that have `CGFloat` values.

- `CGVector`

  This holds `dx` and `dy` properties that have `CGFloat` values.

## Views

Every visible part of an app created with SwiftUI is a view.
Views can render other views.

Each view is a struct that implements the `View` protocol.
This requires having a computed property named `body` with the type `Some View`.

Most properties declared in a `View` struct should be `private`.
Exceptions include the `body` property and
any properties that are passed in when instances are created.
The `body` value is a `ViewBuilder` that
can contain up to 10 child view instances.
When this limit is exceeded, the rather unhelpful error
"Extra argument in call" will be reported.
The `Group` view can be used to work around this limitation
since each `Group` only counts as one view instance.

Views are used for both components and layout.
Views that layout other views are often referred to as
"container" or "combiner" views.

Functions that create views often take a `ViewBuilder` their last argument.
These are typically written as trailing closures.

Views can be given an explicit identifier with the `.id` method
that is passed an identifier.
This is useful in methods that take a view identifier
like the `ScrollViewReader` method `scrollTo`.

To cause a view to take the full width of the screen,
apply the `frame` view modifier.
For example, `myView.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)`.
In can also be useful to specify the height.
For example, `myView.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: 100)`.

Many views utilize the app accent color, also referred to as "global tint".
To set this, select the `Assets.xcassets` file in the Navigator,
select "AccentColor", click the "Universal" swatch,
and click the "Color" dropdown in the Inspector.
Resume Preview to see the change.
This does not affect `Toggle` views which required using the view modifier
`.toggleStyle(SwitchToggleStyle(tint: someColor))`.

### Constants

Custom views often make use of constants.
One recommended way to define constants that are used by multiple source files
is to place them in the file `Constants.swift`.
The contents of this file could be similar to the following:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Constants {
    static let someValue = 19

    struct Colors {
        static let background = Color(hex: 0xf1faff)
        static let disabled = Color.gray
        static let primary = Color(hex: 0x006197)
        static let secondary = Color(hex: 0x3eb3e5)
    }
}
```

Note how a nested struct is used to group related constants.
An example reference to one of these is `Constants.Colors.primary`.

### Running Code When View Appears

There are three ways to specify code to run
when a view is created or first appears.

1. Place code in the view initializer (`init`).
1. Attached an `onAppear` view modifier to the outermost view
   returned by the `body` function.
1. Attached a `task` view modifier to the outermost view
   returned by the `body` function.

The `task` view modifier takes a closure that is run in an asynchronous content
and so can use the `await` keyword.
If the user navigates away from the view before the code is run,
certain asynchronous tasks such as network requests are automatically cancelled.

The `onAppear` view modifier also takes a closure,
but its code can only use the `await` keyword if it is wrapped in a `Task`.

### Extracting Views

When the `body` of a view is longer than what can be displayed on the screen
it is a good idea to extract some of the content.
There are three options for doing this.

1. Move some of the content to a computed property.
2. Move some of the content to a method.
3. Move some of the content to a new struct that
   inherits from `View` and has its own `body` property.

Creating a computed property is useful for cases where the extracted code
is only useful in the current view and no arguments need to be provided.
Creating a method is similar, but allows arguments to be passed.
Creating a new struct is useful when the new view might be used by other views.
In this case, consider moving it to its own source file.

Command-click a view to get a context menu that contains the options
"Extract to Variable", "Extract to Method", and "Extract Subview".

### @State Property Wrapper

All views are immutable structs.
Typically they get data from a model object.
They can also have associated mutable data
by applying the `@State` property wrapper to a property.
This essentially creates a constant pointer inside a view struct
to non-constant data held outside the view struct.
Changes to these properties cause the view body to be rebuilt.

Properties declared with `@State` usually include the `private`
access control keyword because the data is only used by that view.

Updates to `@State` properties should occur in the main queue.
To do this from asynchronous code, wrap the update as follows:

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    myState = newValue
}
```

To initialize a state property based on
data passed to an initializer (`init` method),
prefix the state name with an underscore
and set it to a `State` object.

The following example demonstrates using component state
to implement a counter view:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Counter: View {
    @State private var count = 0

    init() {} // starts with default count value

    init(start: Int) {
        _count = State(initialValue: start)
    }

    // a computed property
    var body: some View {
        // HStack is a container view that arranges it children horizontally.
        HStack {
            Button("-") { count -= 1 }
            Text("\(count)")
            Button("+") { count += 1 }
        }.font(.system(size: 24))
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        // VStack is a container view that arranges it children vertically.
        VStack {
            Counter()
            Counter(start: 7)
        }
    }
}
```

The following example holds the status of a stoplight
in a state property named "status".
Note the use of `$` before the name to
get a two-way binding with a `TextField`.

<img alt="SwiftUI Stoplight" style="width: 50%"

  title="SwiftUI Stoplight">

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct CircleButton: View {
    var color: Color
    var selected: Bool = false
    var action: () -> Void // a function

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: action, label: {
            ZStack {
                Circle().fill(color)
                // Conditional logic can be implemented with an "if" statement,
                // but iteration cannot be implemented with a "for-in" loop.
                // A "ForEach" View must be used instead.
                if selected {
                    Circle().strokeBorder(Color.black, lineWidth: 5)
                }
            }
        })
    }
}

struct Light: Identifiable {
    let id: String
    let color: Color
}

struct MyTextField: View {
    var label: String
    var text: Binding<String>

    var body: some View {
        TextField(label, text: text)
            .autocapitalization(.none)
            .padding()
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
    }
}

// This file must define a struct named "ContentView".
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var status = "stop"

    let lights: [Light] = [
        Light(id: "stop", color: .red),
        Light(id: "yield", color: .yellow),
        Light(id: "go", color: .green)
    ]

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // When iterating over elements that do not conform to
            // the `Identifiable` protocol, add the "id:" argument
            // whose value is a key path that specifies
            // how to find something unique in the element.
            ForEach(lights) { light in
                CircleButton(
                    color: light.color,
                    selected: status == light.id
                ) {
                    status = light.id
                }
            }
            // $ in front of status is needed for a two-way binding.
            MyTextField(label: "status", text: $status)
        }
    }
}
```

## ViewBuilders

Container views can be passed a special kind of closure
as their last argument called a `ViewBuilder`.
This uses list-oriented syntax to describe a list of
one to ten other views that are combined into a single view.
Note that a `ForEach` view counts as a single view.

`ViewBuilder` blocks are parsed differently by the compiler
than ordinary closures.
In addition to containing views,
they can also contain local variable declarations and
conditional logic with `if`, `if let`, and `switch` statements.
However, no other Swift syntax is allowed inside them.

For iteration in a `ViewBuilder`, use a `ForEach` `View`.
There is no corresponding view for conditional logic,
so `if` and `switch` statements are used instead.

`@ViewBuilder` is a custom parameter attribute used to indicate
that a parameter accepts function that returns a list of views.
The list of views can match one of the following types:

- `EmptyView`: zero views
- `TupleView`: two or more views
- `Content?`: generated by an `if` statement to render one view or none
- `_ConditionalContent`: generated by an `if/else` or `switch` statement
  to render one of a set of possible views
  (The underscore indicates that this is a not a public API.)

A `ViewBuilder` is a kind of result builder.
For more information on these, see the {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0289-result-builders.md",
"Result builders proposal" %}.

## View Modifiers

View modifiers are methods that can be called on a view.
They don't modify the view. They create a new view
that is like the receiver, but modified in a specific way.
Calls to view modifiers can be chained since each returns a new view.

The following example uses the `foregroundColor`, `padding`, and `stroke`
view modifiers.

```swift
Text("Hello, World!").foregroundColor(.red)
RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 20).stroke(lineWidth: 3).padding(.all)
```

Some view modifiers can be applied to any view.
Others are specific to certain kinds of views.
For example, the `stroke` view modifier can only be applied
to views that implement the `Shape` protocol.

The official documentation for the supplied view modifiers can be found at
{% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/slider-view-modifiers",
"View Modifiers" %}.

Commonly used view modifiers include:

- `background(alignment, content)`
- `border(ShapeStyle, width: CGFloat = 1)`
- `cornerRadius(CGFloat, antialiased: Bool)`
- `disabled(Bool)` disables any form input such as a `Button`
- `edgesIgnoringSafeArea(Edge.Set)`
- `font(Font?)`
- `foregroundColor(Color?)`
- `foregroundStyle(ShapeStyle)`
- `frame(width: CGFloat?, height: CGFloat?, alignment: Alignment)`
- `frame(maxWidth: CGFloat?, maxHeight: CGFloat?, alignment: Alignment)`
- `border(ShapeStyle, width: CGFloat = 1)`
- `lineLimit(Int?)`
- `multilineTextAlignment(TextAlignment)`
- `offset(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat)`
- `opacity(Double)`
- `overlay(ShapeStyle)`
- `padding(CGFloat)`

The following view modifiers change the styling
of specific kinds of predefined views.

- `buttonStyle(ButtonStyle)`
- `controlGroupStyle(ControlGroupStyle)`
- `datePickerStyle(DatePickerStyle)`
- `gaugeStyle(GaugeStyle)`
- `indexViewStyle(IndexViewStyle)`
- `labelStyle(LabelStyle)`
- `menuStyle(MenuStyle)`
- `navigationViewStyle(NavigationViewStyle)`
- `pickerStyle(PickerStyle)`
- `progressViewStyle(ProgressViewStyle)`
- `presentedWindowStyle(WindowStyle)`
- `presentedWindowToolbarStyle(WindowToolbarStyle)`
- `tableStyle(TableStyle)`
- `tabViewStyle(TabViewStyle)`
- `textFieldStyle(TextFieldStyle)`
- `toggleStyle(ToggleStyle)`

  This can be passed a side which can be a single value or an array
  of `.all` (default),
  `.leading`, `.trailing`, `.horizontal` (same as `.leading` and `.trailing`),
  `.top`, `.bottom`, or `.vertical` (same as `.top` and `.bottom`).
  It can also be passed a `CGFloat` value for the length.
  The length defaults to `nil` and means to use the system default of 20.

- `position(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat)`
- `rotationEffect(Angle, anchor: UnitPoint)`
- `scaledToFill()`
- `scaledToFit()`
- `scaleEffect(x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat, anchor: UnitPoint)`
- `shadow(color: Color, radius: CGFloat, x: CGFloat, y: CGFloat)`
- `textCase(Text.Case?)`
- `tint(Color?)`
- `transformEffect(CGAffineTransform)`
- `transition(AnyTransition)`
- `truncationMode(Text.TruncationMode)`
- `zIndex(Double)`

The following example adds a shadow to a `Text` view:

<img alt="SwiftUI Shadow" style="width: 60%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Shadow.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI Shadow">

```swift
Text("Shadow Demo")
    .padding()
    .background(.yellow)
    .shadow(color: .gray, radius: 3, x: 3, y: 3)
```

The event handling methods like `onTapGesture` area also view modifiers.

Several view modifiers take a `ShapeStyle` object.
Types that conform to the `ShapeStyle` protocol include
`AngularGradient`, `Color`, `ForegroundStyle`, `ImagePaint`,
`LinearGradient`, and `RadialGradient`.

Many view modifiers are defined in extensions to the `View` protocol.
This makes them applicable to any kind of view.

When view modifiers are added to container views,
they are passed down to all descendant views.
In the following example, all the `Text` views are red
because the `VStack` that contains them has
a view modifier that sets the foreground color.

```swift
VStack {
    Text("Alpha")
    HStack {
        Text("Beta")
        Text("Gamma")
    }
}.foregroundColor(.red)
```

In a way, view modifiers are like Svelte components that contain slots.
They take a view to be "modified" and return a new view
that typically contains the view passed to them.

Custom view modifiers can be created by defining
a struct that implements the `ViewModifier` protocol.
This requires implementing `body` method that takes
content which is a `View` to be modified,
and returns a new `View`.
The code in the `body` method is similar to that in any custom view.

The following code defines a custom `ViewModifier`
that allows the view on which it is called to be collapsed.
It wraps that view in a `VStack` containing two `HStack`s.
The second `HStack` includes a `Button` containing a chevron icon.
Clicking the `Button` toggles whether the first `HStack` is rendered.
It also rotates the chevron icon using animation
which is covered later in the "Animation" section.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Collapsible: ViewModifier {
    private static let diameter = CGFloat(120)
    private static var radius: CGFloat { diameter / 2 }

    var bgColor: Color = .gray
    var duration: Double = 0.5 // in seconds

    @State private var showContent = true

    var halfCircle: some View {
        Circle()
            .trim(from: 0, to: 0.5)
            .fill(bgColor)
            .frame(
                width: Collapsible.diameter,

    private func toggle() {
        withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: duration)) {

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        VStack {
            if showContent {
                HStack {
                    Spacer()
                    content
                    Spacer()
                }
                .background(bgColor)

                //TODO: Can you scale the height of the HStack
                //TODO: instead of using the default fade transition?
                //.transition(.scale)
                //.scaleEffect(showContent ? 1 : 0)
                //.animation(.easeInOut(duration: 1))
            }
            HStack {
                Spacer()
                ZStack {
                    Image(systemName: "chevron.down")
                        .resizable()
                        .frame(
                            width: Collapsible.radius / 3,
                            height: Collapsible.radius / 4
                        )
                        .onTapGesture { toggle() }
                        .rotationEffect( // Angle type is inferred
                            .degrees(showContent ? 180 : 0)
                        )
                        .offset(x: 0, y: -2)
                        .background(halfCircle)
                }
                Spacer()
            }
        }
    }
}

extension View {
    func collapsible(
        bgColor: Color = .black,
        duration: Double = 0.5) -> some View {
        modifier(Collapsible(bgColor: bgColor, duration: duration))
    }
}
```

The following code demonstrates using the custom `ViewModifier` defined above.

```swift
VStack {
    Text("First line of content")
    Text("Second line of content")
}
.padding()

// This way of applying a view modifier doesn't use the View extension.
//.modifier(Collapsible(bgColor: ContentView.bgColor))

// This way uses the View extension and is preferred.
.collapsible(bgColor: ContentView.bgColor)
```

## Property Wrappers

Swift property wrappers attach logic to the properties
of classes, structs, and enums.

SwiftUI supports the following property wrappers:

### @Binding

This property wrapper is applied to a property of a child view
that is passed a binding (`$` syntax) from a parent view.
It connects a child property to a parent property.
This allows the child view to get and set a property that
is owned by a parent view and si passed in as an argument.

```swift
struct ChildView: View {
    @Binding var n: Int

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("ChildView: n = \(n)")
            Button("Increment") {
                n += 1
            }
            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
        }
    }
}

struct ParentView: View {
    @State var number = 0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("ParentView: number = \(number)")
            ChildView(n: $number) // $ is required to pass a binding
        }
    }
}
```

To pass a binding to a constant value, use `.constant(value)`.

### @Environment

This is used to access environment values.
See the "Environment" section.

### @EnvironmentObject

The `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper allows multiple views
to share access to an `ObservableObject`.

The following code demonstrates this.
It works in the Simulator, but not in Preview.

```swift
// Environment objects must be defined by classes
// that conform to the ObservableObject protocol
// and they should publish at least one property.
class SharedData: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name = "Mark"
    @Published var score = 0
}

struct ChildView: View {
    // This value will be received from the environment.
    @EnvironmentObject var sharedData: SharedData

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("ChildView: name = \(sharedData.name)")
            Text("ChildView: score = \(sharedData.score)")
            Button("Increment Score") {
                // This change will be published to all views
                // that use the SharedData score property.
                sharedData.score += 1
            }
            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
            GrandchildView()
        }
        .environmentObject(sharedData)
    }
}

struct GrandchildView: View {
    // This value will be received from the environment.
    @EnvironmentObject var sharedData: SharedData

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("GrandchildView: name = \(sharedData.name)")
            Text("GrandchildView: score = \(sharedData.score)")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var sharedData = SharedData()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("ContentView: name = \(sharedData.name)")
            Text("ContentView: score = \(sharedData.score)")
            ChildView()
        }
        // All views inside this VStack can access the sharedData object.
        // The environmentObject view modifier can be called
        // multiple times, but only once for each type because
        // the type is how the values are distinguished.
        .environmentObject(sharedData)
    }
}

### @State

This property wrapper was described earlier
near the end of the section on "Views".
It enables view structs to maintain state.
This is intended for storing basic values with types like
`Bool`, `Int`, `Double`, and `String`.

When the value of a normal struct property
(declared without a property wrapper)
is modified, a new instance of the struct is created.
This happens because structs are value types.

We don't want a new instance to be created for structs that represent views.
Applying the `@State` property wrapper to a struct property
prevents this because SwiftUI manages the value outside of the struct.
When the value of this kind of property is changed,
the view `body` is recomputed.

This is somewhat like the `useState` hook in React.

An `@State` property can also store more complex types.
However if it is used to store a class instance (a reference type)
and a property of the class is modified,
the associated view `body` will not be recomputed.
A new class instance must be created to trigger an update.

Note that using a `struct` instead of a `class`
in the scenario described above does work.
The reason is that changing the value of a struct property
creates a new instance of the struct.
However, this may not be desirable because
it copies every property of the struct.

### @StateObject

This creates an instance of an `ObservableObject`
which is an object that publishes changes to its properties
that are annotated with the `@Published` property wrapper.
When the values of these properties change,
the associated view `body` will be recomputed.

Applying the `@StateObject` property wrapper
to a view property that holds a class instance
allows the view `body` to be recomputed when the
value of any published property of the class instance is modified.
The following example demonstrates this.

```swift
class MyState: ObservableObject {
    @Published var score: Int = 0
    // Could declare additional published properties here.
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var myState = MyState()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Increment") {
                myState.score += 1
            }
            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
            Text("score = \(myState.score)")
        }
    }
}
```

### @ObservedObject

This subscribes to an observable object
and recomputes the associated view `body` when it changes.
It is used in cases when an observable object is passed into a view.
The following example demonstrates this.

```swift
class MyState: ObservableObject {
    @Published var score: Int = 0
    // Could declare additional published properties here.
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @ObservedObject var share: MyState

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("ChildView: Increment") {
                // This also updates myState in ContentView.
                share.score += 1
            }
            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
            Text("ChildView: score = \(share.score)")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var myState = MyState()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("ContentView: Increment") {
                // This also updates share in ChildView.
                myState.score += 1
            }
            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
            Text("ContentView: score = \(myState.score)")

            // Passing the @StateObject variable.
            ChildView(share: myState)
        }
    }
}
```

## Colors

Colors are defined by the `Color` struct.
It provides many static properties for predefined colors
and many initializers for specifying custom colors.

A "color literal" displays a color swatch in source code.
To create one, enter `Color(#colorLiteral())`.
The part passed to `Color` will be replaced by a color swatch.
Double-click the swatch to select a different color.
Click the "Other..." button to open the system color picker
which provides many more ways to select a color.

It is recommended to use the predefined system colors
because they are dynamic, meaning that the actual color used
automatically changes when switching between light and dark mode.
To use these in code, enter `Color(UIColor.system)`
and select a system color from the code completion popup.

Typically `Color.primary` is used for text because it
automatically switches between black for light mode and white for dark mode.
This is the default `foregroundColor` of `Text` views.

There are several ways to switch between light and dark mode in the simulator.

1. Press cmd-shift-a (easiest).
2. Open the Settings app, select Developer,
   and change the "Dark Appearance" toggle.
3. Apply the following view modifier to the top-most view:
   `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)` or `.light`
4. Apply the following view modifier to the top-most view:
   `.environment(\.colorScheme, .light)` or `.dark`

To define a custom named color pair, one for light mode and one for dark:

- In the Navigator, select the "Assets.xcassets" file.
- Right-click in the list of assets and select "New Color Set".
- Change the default name "Color" to the name that will be specified in code.
- Click the "Any Appearance" swatch (used for light mode).
- Click the "Attributes" tab in the Inspector (4th tab with sliders icon).
- In the Inspector, select a color.
- Click the "Dark" swatch.
- In the Inspector, select a color.
  Consider selecting the same color used for "Any Appearance".
  Then click the "Show Color Panel" button,
  change the slider type drop-down to "HSB Sliders",
  and reduce the value for Brightness (perhaps to 50%).

To use a custom color in code, enter `Color("some-name")`.

UIKit uses `UIColor` instead of `Color`.
To create a `UIColor` from a `Color`,
pass the `Color` to a `UIColor` initializer.
For example, `let redUIColor = UIColor(Color.red)`.

## Container Views

Container views act as a container of other views
and layout those views in a specific way.

To hide a view but still take up the space that would be occupied
if the view was visible, consider setting its opacity to zero.
This is done with the `opacity` view modifier.
For example, `someView.opacity(0)`.

To automate wrapping views in a container view,
select them and command-click to get a context menu that contains the options
"Embed in HStack", "Embed in VStack", "Embed in ZStack", "Embed in List",
and "Embed..." (for embedding in an arbitrary container).

Here are the container views that are provided by SwiftUI.

### `HStack`

This lays out child views horizontally.

The child views are centered vertically by default.
To change this, add the `alignment` attribute which can be set to
`.top`, `.center`, `.bottom`, `.firstTextBaseline`, or `.lastTextBaseline`.

A default amount of space is added between each child
which seems to be 8 pixels (can't find this documented).
To change the space between child views, add the `spacing` attribute.

The following example shows the effect of
setting `alignment` to `.lastTextBaseLine`.

<img alt="SwiftUI HStack" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-HStack.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI HStack">

```swift
HStack(alignment: .lastTextBaseline, spacing: 0) {
    Rectangle()
        .fill(.red)
        .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
        .border(.black)
    Rectangle()
        .fill(.green)
        .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
        .border(.black)
    Text("Line 1\nLine 2").padding(20).border(.black)
}.border(.blue)
```

### `VStack`

This lays out child views vertically.

The child views are centered horizontally by default.
To change this, add the `alignment` attribute which can be set to
`.leading`, `.center`, or `.trailing`.

### `ZStack`

This stacks views from bottom to top.
It is ideal for adding a background to a set of views.

Here are three approaches to rendering text with a colored background,
one of which uses a `ZStack`.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let bgColor: Color = .yellow
    let text = "Test"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            let rect = Rectangle()
                .fill(bgColor)
                .frame(width: 50, height: 40)
            // Semicolons must separate multiple statements
            // on the same line.
            ZStack { rect; Text(text) }
            Text(text)
                .padding(10)
                .background(Rectangle().foregroundColor(bgColor))
            rect.overlay(Text(text))
        }
    }
}
```

### `LazyHStack`

This is similar to `HStack`, but only
builds and renders child views when they are visible.
It is commonly used inside a `ScrollView` with `axes` set to `.horizontal`.

```swift
ScrollView(.horizontal) {
    LazyHStack {
        ForEach(1..<100) {
            Text(String($0))
        }
    }
}
```

### `LazyVStack`

This is similar to `VStack`, but only
builds and renders child views when they are visible.
It is commonly used inside a `ScrollView` with `axes` set to `.vertical`,
which is the default.

```swift
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack {
        ForEach(1..<101) {
            Text(String($0))
        }
    }
}
```

### `LazyHGrid`

This specifies a number of rows and adds columns as necessary.
The grids are described by an array of {% aTargetBlank
  "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/griditem", "GridItem" %}
objects that each specify their size, spacing, and alignment.
For example, a `GridItem` can adapt to the width of its content,
but also have a minimum size of 25 by specifying
`GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: 25))`.

See the example in `LazyVGrid` below.

### `LazyVGrid`

This is similar to `LazyHGrid`, but
specifies a number of columns and adds rows as necessary.

The following example demonstrates both `LazyHGrid` and `LazyVGrid`.
It spreads a list of numbers over either rows or columns.

<img alt="SwiftUI LazyHGrid and LazyVGrid" style="width: 40%"
      src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Lazy-Grids.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
      title="SwiftUI LazyHGrid and LazyVGrid">

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  private static let count = 4
  @State private var isVertical = false // Why can't this be static?

  // Describe the characteristics of each grid.
  private static let gridItem = GridItem(
      // This specifies the grid height in LazyHGrid
      // or the grid width in LazyVGrid.
      .fixed(40),
      // This specifies the vertical spacing in LazyHGrid
      // or horizontal spacing in LazyVGrid.
      spacing: 10,
      alignment: .trailing
  )

  var gridItems: [GridItem] = Array(repeating: gridItem, count: count)

  var body: some View {
      VStack {
          if isVertical {
              ScrollView {
                  LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
                      ForEach(1..<101) {
                          Text(String($0)).padding(5).border(.blue, width: 3)
                      }
                  }
                  .padding()
                  .border(.red, width: 5)
              }
          } else {
              ScrollView(.horizontal) {
                  LazyHGrid(rows: gridItems) {
                      ForEach(1..<101) {
                          Text(String($0)).padding(5).border(.blue, width: 3)
                      }
                  }
                  .padding()
                  .border(.red, width: 3)
              }
          }
          Button("Toggle Direction") {
              isVertical.toggle()
          }.buttonStyle(.bordered)
      }
  }
}
```

The following example demonstrates `LazyVGrid`
where the views created are intended for specific columns.

<img alt="SwiftUI LazyVGrid" style="width: 40%"
      src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-LazyVGrid.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
      title="SwiftUI LazyVGrid">

```swift
func intPow(_ base: Int, _ exponent: Int) -> Int {
    Int(pow(Float(base), Float(exponent)))
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        let columns: [GridItem] =
            Array(
                repeating: GridItem(.flexible(), alignment: .trailing),
                count: 3
            )

        ScrollView {
            LazyVGrid(columns: columns) {
                Text("Number").font(.title)
                Text("Squared").font(.title)
                Text("Cubed").font(.title)
                ForEach(1 ... 50, id: \.self) { number in
                    Text("\(number)")
                    Text("\(intPow(number, 2))")
                    Text("\(intPow(number, 3))")
                }
            }
            .padding(.horizontal)
        }
    }
}
```

### `Form`

This is a container of data entry views.

The following example demonstrates many common views used in forms.

<img alt="SwiftUI Form" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Form.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI Form">

```swift
enum ShirtSize: String, CaseIterable {
  case small
  case medium
  case large
  case extraLarge
}

struct ContentView: View {
    private static let blogUrl = "https://mvolkmann.github.io/blog"

    // Typically form data would be tied to ViewModel properties
    // rather than using @State.
    @State private var bedTime: Date = Date()
    @State private var birthday: Date = Date()
    @State private var favoriteColor: Color = .yellow
    @State private var dogCount = 0
    @State private var hungry = false
    @State private var name = ""
    @State private var motto = "This is my motto."
    @State private var rating = 0.0
    @State private var shirtSize: ShirtSize = .large

    var isEditing = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Form {
                Section(header: Text("Profile")) {
                    TextField("Name", text: $name)
                    DatePicker(
                        "Birthday",
                        selection: $birthday,
                        displayedComponents: .date
                    )
                    Toggle("Hungry?", isOn: $hungry)
                        .toggleStyle(SwitchToggleStyle(tint: .red))
                }
                Section(header: Text("Preferences")) {
                    // Links work in Simulator, but not in Preview.
                    Link(
                        "Blog",
                        destination: URL(string: ContentView.blogUrl)!
                    )
                    VStack {
                        Text("Motto")
                        // It seems TextEditor lineLimit is
                        // only enforced on initial render.
                        // It doesn't prevent more lines from being
                        // displayed if the user types more text.
                        TextEditor(text: $motto).lineLimit(2)
                    }
                    ColorPicker(
                        "Favorite Color",
                        selection: $favoriteColor
                    )
                    DatePicker(
                        "Bed Time",
                        selection: $bedTime,
                        displayedComponents: .hourAndMinute
                    )
                    Picker("Shirt Size", selection: $shirtSize) {
                        ForEach(ShirtSize.allCases, id: \.self) { size in
                            Text("\(size.rawValue)").tag(size)
                        }
                    }
                    HStack {
                        Text("Rating")
                        Slider(value: $rating, in: 0...10, step: 1)
                        Text("\(Int(rating))")
                    }
                    HStack {
                        Stepper(
                            "# of Dogs",
                            value: $dogCount, in: 0...10
                        )
                        Text(String(dogCount))
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Profile")
            // accentColor changes the color of many elements including
            // the text cursor color, focus color, and Slider bar color.
            // It does not affect the focus background color of Toggle
            // views.  Use the "toggleStyle" view modifier for that.
            .accentColor(.red)
            .toolbar {
                ToolbarItemGroup(placement: .navigationBarTrailing) {
                    // The saveUser function is not shown here.
                    Button("Save", action: saveUser)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Common UI components that are not built into SwiftUI include:

- checkbox: alternative is Toggle
- image picker: must build or use a library
- multiple choice: alternative is `List`
  inside `NavigationView` with an `EditButton`
- radio buttons: alternative is `Picker`, supported in macOS with
  `Picker` and `.pickerStyle(RadioGroupPickerStyle())`
- toggle buttons: alternative is `Picker`

### `Section`

These break a view into sections that are optionally labelled.
They are also optionally collapsible.
This was used in the `Form` example above.

### `Group`

This collects all its child views into a single view
without changing their layout.
View modifiers applied to the `Group` are applied to each of the children.

```swift
Group {
    Text("One")
    Text("Two")
}.foregroundColor(.blue)
```

### `GroupBox`

This creates a logical grouping of other views
with an optional `Label` at the top.

<img alt="SwiftUI GroupBox" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-GroupBox.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI GroupBox">

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    static let text = "Known as the Great One, Wayne Gretzky holds more NHL records than any other player in history."

    @State private var like = true

    var body: some View {
        GroupBox(
            label: Label(
                "Wayne Gretzky",
                systemImage: "sportscourt"
            ).font(.title)
        ) {
            ScrollView {
                Text(ContentView.text)
            }.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: 130)
            Toggle("Like", isOn: $like)
        }.padding()
    }
}
```

### `ControlGroup`

This groups related controls.
It is typically used with `Button` views.
There are two built-in styles, `automatic` (default) and `navigation`.

<img alt="SwiftUI ControlGroup" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-ControlGroup.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI ControlGroup">

```swift
ControlGroup {
    Button("Cancel") {
        print("canceling")
    }
    Button("Save") {
        print("saving")
    }
}
ControlGroup {
    Button("Cancel") {
        print("canceling")
    }
    Button("Save") {
        print("saving")
    }
}.controlGroupStyle(.navigation)
```

### `ScrollView`

This creates a scrollable view that is vertical by default,
but can be changed to horizontal.
It occupies all the space offered to it.
Scrolling reveals additional child views when all of them do not fit.
See examples of using this in the
descriptions of `LazyHStack` and `LazyVStack`.

### `ScrollViewReader`

This is a view that supports programmatic scrolling.

<img alt="SwiftUI ScrollViewReader" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-ScrollViewReader.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI ScrollViewReader">

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  @Namespace var topId
  @Namespace var bottomId

  var body: some View {
      ScrollViewReader { proxy in
          ScrollView {
              Button("Scroll to Bottom") {
                  withAnimation {
                      proxy.scrollTo(bottomId)
                  }
              }
              .id(topId)

              VStack(spacing: 0) {
                  ForEach(1 ..< 101) { i in
                      Text(String(i))
                  }
              }

              Button("Scroll to Top") {
                  withAnimation {
                      proxy.scrollTo(topId)
                  }
              }
              .id(bottomId)
          }
      }
  }
}
```

### `ScrollViewProxy`

An instance of this type is passed to the trailing closure
of `ScrollViewReader`. See the example above.

### `List`

This displays a list of views in a single column.
It also acts like `ForEach` for iterating over array elements.
For more detail, see the "List" section below.

### `ForEach`

This view iterates of the elements of a `RandomAccessCollection`
(includes `Array` and `Range` types)
and renders the view specified in its `ViewBuilder`.

The elements in the `RandomAccessCollection` must either conform to
the `Identifiable` protocol (which requires them to have an `id` property)
OR the `id:` argument must be set.
This is important! If the elements are not `Identifiable`
and no `id:` argument is supplied, the view
may not update property when the collection changes.

Only constant ranges are allowed (ex. `0..<5`, but not `begin..<end`).
The value of `id:` is a key path that specifies
how to find a unique value in the element.
For example, the `String` type does not implement `Identifiable`.
To iterate over an array of `String` values:

```swift
// \.self is a key path that refers to the entire object.
ForEach(stringArray, id: \.self) { ... }
```

### `Table`

This is only available in macOS 12 and above.
The following example demonstrates using a `Table`
that supports row selection and column sorting.

```swift
struct Dog: Identifiable {
  let name: String
  let breed: String
  let color: String
  let id = UUID()
}

private var dogs = [ // initially sorted on name
    Dog(name: "Comet", breed: "Whippet", color: "black brindle"),
    Dog(name: "Maisey", breed: "Treeing Walker Coonhound", color: "black"),
    Dog(name: "Oscar", breed: "German Shorthaired Pointer", color: "white"),
    Dog(name: "Ramsay", breed: "Native American Indian Dog", color: "gray")
]

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var selectedDogs = Set<Dog.ID>()
    @State private var sortOrder = [KeyPathComparator(\Dog.name)] // initial

    var body: some View {
        Table(dogs, selection: $selectedDogs, sortOrder: $sortOrder) {
            TableColumn("Name", value: \.name)
            TableColumn("Breed", value: \.breed)
            TableColumn("Color", value: \.color)
        }
        // Why do these view modifiers have no effect?
        //.tableStyle(InsetTableStyle.inset(alternatesRowBackgrounds: true))
        //.tableStyle(BorderedTableStyle.bordered(alternatesRowBackgrounds: true))

        // Why does the first click on a table heading do nothing?
        .onChange(of: sortOrder) { dogs.sort(using: $0) }
        Text("\(selectedDogs.count) dogs selected")
    }
}
```

### `NavigationView`

This marks an area where a stack of views will be rendered one at a time.
It contains `NavigationLink` views that are similar to HTML anchor elements.
Tapping them causes the associated view
to be rendered inside the `NavigationView`.
See the "Navigation" section later.

### `NavigationLink`

These are used inside a `NavigationView`.
See the "Navigation" section later.

### `OutlineGroup`

This displays a tree of data with disclosure angle brackets.
See my {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/mvolkmann/SwiftUI-OutlineGroup/blob/main/SwiftUI-OutlineGroup/ContentView.swift",
"SwiftUI-OutlineGroup" %} project and the questions in it.

### `DisclosureGroup`

This hides and shows its contents based on whether it is in an expanded state.
By default it is not expanded.
It can be expanded by tapping or by associating
a `Bool` binding that is programmatically set to `true`.

<img alt="SwiftUI DisclosureGroup" style="width: 40%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-DisclosureGroup.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI DisclosureGroup">

```swift
@State private var cyclist = false
@State private var firstName = ""
@State private var lastName = ""
@State private var personalExpanded = true
@State private var runner = false

var body: some View {
    Form {
        DisclosureGroup("Personal", isExpanded: $personalExpanded) {
            TextField("First Name", text: $firstName)
            TextField("Last Name", text: $lastName)
        }

        DisclosureGroup("Preferences") {
            Toggle("Runner", isOn: $runner)
            Toggle("Cyclist", isOn: $cyclist)
        }
    }
}
```

### `TabView`

This creates a row of buttons at the bottom of the display
that can be tapped to navigate to associated views.
If there are more than five buttons, the first four will render followed by
along with a "More" button.
The "More" button can be tapped to go a view containing
a tappable list of the remaining options.

From the docs, "Tab views only support tab items of type Text, Image,
or an image followed by text. Passing any other type of view
results in a visible but empty tab item."
A good size for these images is 32x32.

To use `TabView` in conjunction with `NavigationView`,
wrap each page in its own `NavigationView`
rather than placing the `TabView` inside a `NavigationView`.
Having a `NavigationView` for each page
allows use of the `toolbar` view modifier
to add a toolbar at the top of each page.

<img alt="SwiftUI TabView" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-TabView.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI TabView">

```swift
struct Transportation: View {
    var kind: String

    var body: some View {
        Text("Information about \(kind) transportation goes here.")
            .navigationBarTitle("\(kind) Transportation")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            Transportation(kind: "Car").tabItem {
                Label("Car", systemImage: "car")
            }
            Transportation(kind: "Bus").tabItem {
                Label("Bus", systemImage: "bus")
            }
            Transportation(kind: "Train").tabItem {
                Label("Train", systemImage: "tram")
            }
            Transportation(kind: "Airplane").tabItem {
                Label("Airplane", systemImage: "airplane")
            }
        }
        .onAppear() {
            UITabBar.appearance().backgroundColor = .systemGray5
        }
        // Change color of Image and Text views which defaults to blue.
        .accentColor(.purple)
    }
}
```

By default the first tab is initially displayed.
To start on another tab, add a state variable
that holds the tag of the desired initial tab.

```swift
@State private var selection = 3
...
TabView(selection: $selection) {
    ...
    SomeView().tabItem {
        ...
    }
    .tag(3)
}
```

Here's another example that displays a set of pages
the user can swipe through.
Page controls with a dot representing each page are displayed at the bottom.

<img alt="SwiftUI TabView Pages" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-TabView-Pages.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI TabView Pages">

```swift
struct Page: View {
    var title: String
    var description: String
    var imageName: String

    var body: some View {
       VStack {
            Text(title).font(.headline)
            Image(systemName: imageName)
                .resizable()
                .scaledToFit() // or .scaledToFill()
                .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
                .foregroundColor(.red)
            Text(description)
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TabView {
            Page(
                title: "Planes",
                description: "Fly like the wind!",
                imageName: "airplane"
            )
            Page(
                title: "Trains",
                description: "Travel the tracks!",
                imageName: "tram"
            )
            Page(
                title: "Automobiles",
                description: "Drive the open road!",
                imageName: "car"
            )
        }
        .tabViewStyle(.page(indexDisplayMode: .always))
        .indexViewStyle(.page(backgroundDisplayMode: .always))
    }
}
```

### `HSplitView`

This is a layout container that organizes its children horizontally
and allows users to resize the children by dragging dividers between them.
It is only supported in macOS.

### `VSplitView`

This is a layout container that organizes its children vertically
and allows users to resize the children by dragging dividers between them.
It is only supported in macOS.

### `TimelineView`

This is a container that re-renders its children at scheduled times.
The following example renders the date and time every second.
For example, "Nov 8, 2021 at 5:19:47".

```swift
private var dateFormatter: DateFormatter {
    let df = DateFormatter()
    df.dateFormat = "MMM d, YYYY 'at' h:mm:ss a"
    return df
}

private let schedule = PeriodicTimelineSchedule(from: Date(), by: 1)

var body: some View {
    VStack {
        TimelineView(schedule) { context in
            Text(dateFormatter.string(from: context.date))
        }
    }
}
```

## Component Views

### `Button`

The content of a `Button` can be specified in two ways,
passing a `String` as the first argument or using the `label` argument
which can be specified with a trailing closure.

A `Button` specifies a function to call when pressed
using the `action` argument
which can also be written as a trailing closure.

By default buttons have no border, no background color,
and the text is the accent color.

When the `buttonStyle` view modifier is passed `.bordered`,
the background is gray.
When the `buttonStyle` view modifier is passed `.borderedProminent`,
the background is the accent color and the text is white.
In both cases no actual border is drawn.
They just add a background color inside a rounded rectangle.

To change the border shape, apply the `buttonBorderShape` view modifier
passing it `.capsule`, `.roundedRectangle`,
or `.roundedRectangle(radius: cornerRadius)`.
This only takes effect when the `buttonStyle` view modifier is also applied.

To change the text color,
apply the `foregroundColor` view modifier passing it a `Color`.

When their `role` attribute is set to `.destructive`, the text is red.
When their `role` attribute is set to `.cancel`, `.none`, or not specified,
there is no visible change.

To change the background color,
apply the `tint` view modifier passing it a `Color`.

To change the size, apply the `controlSize` modifier,
passing it `.small` or `.large` (default is `.regular`).

To disable a `Button`,
apply the `disabled` view modifier passing it a `Bool`.

```swift
// Button containing text and action specified with a trailing closure.
Button("My Label", role: .destructive) {
    // code to run when button is pressed
}.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)

// Button with an "action" argument whose value
// can be a closure or a function reference
// and a "contents" argument whose value is a ViewBuilder
// that can be written as a trailing closure.
Button(action: {
    // code to run when button is pressed
}) {
    HStack {
        Text("Heart")
        Image(systemName: "heart")
    }
}
```

When there are multiple buttons on the same row of a `Form` or `List`,
tapping any of them runs all of their actions
instead of just the action of the tapped `Button`.
One fix for this is to add `.buttonStyle(.borderless)` to each of the buttons.
This is demonstrated in the simple app below.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var number = 0

    var body: some View {
        // VStack { // no issues
        // List { // has bug
        Form { // has bug
            HStack {
                Button("One") { number = 1 }
                Button("Two") { number = 2 }
                Button("Three") { number = 3 }
            }
            .buttonStyle(.borderless) // fixes the bug

            Text("You tapped button #\(number)").padding()
        }
    }
}
```

### `Color`

This creates a rectangular view with a specific background color
that grows to fill all the space offered to it.
For example, `Color.red` and `Color.clear` (transparent) are views.

A `UIColor` can be converted to a `Color`.
For example, `UIColor.blue` can be converted with `Color(.systemBlue)`.

### `Image`

This renders an image.
Many image formats are supported including PNG, JPEG, and HEIC.
To add images, click `Assets.xcassets` in the Navigator.
Click the "+" in the lower-left to add an entry.
Give the entry a name and drag images into the 1x, 2x, and 3x boxes.
Pass the name to the `Image` view as an unlabelled argument.
For example, `Image("Comet")`.

Icons from SF Symbols can be used by specifying
their name as the `systemName` argument.
For example, `Image(systemName: "cloud.snow")`.

`Image` views are not resizable by default.
To make them resizable, apply the `resizable` view modifier.

To maintain the original aspect ratio,
apply the `aspectRatio` view modifier.
This takes a `contentMode` argument which can
have the values `.fill` and `.fit`.
These are equivalent: `.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)` and `.scaledToFill()`.
And these are equivalent: `.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)` and `.scaledToFit()`.

To change an `Image` to have a size different from its default,
apply the `frame` view modifier.

A new size can cause the image to skew.
To clip an image to a given shape, apply the `clipShape` view modifier.

The order in which these view modifiers are applied is important.
Here is an example of correct usage.

```swift
Image("some-name")
    .resizable()
    .scaledToFill()
    .frame(width: 300, height: 300)
    .clipShape(Circle())
```

### `AsyncImage`

This asynchronously loads and displays an image.
A specified placeholder image is displayed
while the specified image is being downloaded.
It works in the Simulator, but not in Preview.

The following example renders the Swift logo:

<img alt="SwiftUI AsyncImage" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-AsyncImage.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI AsyncImage">

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    private let imageUrl =
        "https://developer.apple.com/swift/images/swift-og.png"
    private let size = 100.0

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            AsyncImage(
                url: URL(string: imageUrl),
                content: { image in
                    image
                        .resizable()
                        .frame(width: size, height: size)
                },
                placeholder: { ProgressView() } // spinner
            )
        }
    }
}
```

`AsyncImage` does not cache downloaded images,
so they can be downloaded multiple times.
To cache the images, see this {% aTargetBlank
"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69214543/how-can-i-add-caching-to-asyncimage",
"Stack Overflow post" %}.

### `Text`

This view renders text.
If the text is too long to fit on a single line,
it is automatically wrapped to additional lines.
To prevent this, apply the `lineLimit` view modifier
and pass the number of lines that can be used (perhaps 1).
If the text doesn't fit in the allowed number of lines,
it will be elided and an ellipsis will appear at the end.

To set the foreground color, apply the `foregroundColor` view modifier.
To set the font size, apply the `font` view modifier.

```swift
Text("Hello World").foregroundColor(.red).font(.system(size: 24))
```

The `Text` view can only be passed a `String`.
Other types such as `Int` and `Double` must be converted to `String`.
Consider extending `Text` to add initializers for other types.
For example:

```swift
extension Text {
    init(_ number: Int) {
        self.init(String(number))
    }
}
```

The `minimumScaleFactor(percent)` view modifier can be applied to a `Text` view.
It causes the font size to be scaled down in order to get the text
to fit within its frame.
For example, `Text(myTitle).font(.title).minimumScaleFactor(0.75)`
will use the `title` font size if the text will fit,
but will scale as low as 75% of that font size.
It uses the largest size that will fit that is between
100% and 75% of the requested font size.
If the text doesn't fit at 75% of the requested font size,
it will be elided (truncated with ... at the end).

The `lineLimit(n)` view modifier can be applied to a `Text` view.
It limits the number of lines on which the text can be wrapped.
If more lines are needed, the text is elided.

Both view modifiers described above can be applied to the same `Text` view
to achieve both effects.

### `TextField`

This provides single-line text entry.
It also works with non-String types using a `FormatStyle` object
to convert between `String` values and the type.
It takes label text, a binding to a variable, and an optional prompt.
In macOS apps, the label precedes the input area
and the prompt is used as placeholder text.
In iOS apps, no text precedes the input area
and the prompt or label is used as placeholder text.

The style can be set with the `textFieldStyle` view modifier.
The options are `plain` (default) and `roundedBorder`.
When the `plain` style is used, it's not obvious that the value can be edited
unless it is wrapped in a `Form`.

Auto-capitalization of words is provided by default.
To disable this, pass `.none` to the `autocapitalization` view modifier.

Auto-correction is provided by default.
To disable this, pass `true` to the `disableAutocorrection` view modifier.

```swift
// No prompt
TextField("First Name", text: $firstName)
    .padding()
    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)

// Prompt specified
TextField(text: $lastName, prompt: Text("Required")) {
    Text("Last Name")
}
.textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
.padding()

// Using a non-String value (Int)
// This doesn't provide arrows to increment and decrement the value
// and it doesn't prevent typing non-digit characters.
TextField("Score", value: $score, format: .number)
    .padding()
    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
```

### `SecureField`

This is like `TextField`, but obscures the characters that are typed.
It is typically used for sensitive data like
passwords and social security numbers.

```swift
SecureField("Password", text: $password)
    .autocapitalization(.none)
    .disableAutocorrection(true)
```

### `TextEditor`

This provides multi-line text entry.
The number of lines can be limited,
but it seems the limit is only enforced on initial render.
It doesn't prevent more lines from being
displayed if the user types more text.
Use the `frame` view modifier to set the size.

```swift
let lines = 3
TextEditor(text: $reasonForVisit)
    .lineLimit(lines)
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: CGFloat(lines * 24))
    .overlay(
        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 5)
            .stroke(Color(UIColor.lightGray))
    )
```

### `EditButton`

This toggles the edit mode of a `List`.
It is typically added to a `List` using the `toolbar` view modifier.
See the example in the "Lists" section.

### `PasteButton`

This is only available in macOS 10.15 and above.
It renders a button for pasting data from the system clipboard.

### `Link`

This creates a hyperlink like an HTML `a` element.
Clicking it opens the associated URL in Safari.
These work in the Simulator, but Preview is not able to open Safari.

```swift
Link(
    "link text",
    destination: URL(string: "https://some-domain/some-path"
)

Link(
    destination: URL(string: "https://some-domain/some-path"),
    label: SomeView
)
```

### `Menu`

This renders a label containing the menu title.
When clicked, a menu appears below the label
containing a vertical stack of buttons and sub-menus.
Include `Divider` views to separate groups of menu items.

The order of the buttons depends on the position of the menu.
If it is near the bottom of the display,
the button order is reversed in order to make all the buttons visible
and keep the first button close to the label.

```swift
Menu("My Menu") {
    Button("Option 1", action: {})
    Button("Option 2", action: {})
    Menu("Option 3") {
        Button("Option 3.1", action: {})
        Button("Option 3.2", action: {})
    }
}
```

The following example uses a `Menu` to
select the color used to fill a `Rectangle`.

```swift
@State private var color = Color.red

var body: some View {
    VStack {
        Menu("Color") {
            Button("Red") { color = .red }
            Button("Green") { color = .green }
            Button("Blue") { color = .blue }
        }
        Rectangle().fill(color).frame(width: 50, height: 50)
    }
}
```

### `Toggle`

This enables toggling between on and off states.
By default it renders as a switch with a circular thumb.

The app accent color does not affect switch-style rendering.
To change the color of the switch background,
use the `toggleStyle` view modifier to specify a tint.

A `Toggle` can also render as a button whose
color indicates whether it is off or on.
When it is off, the button background color is clear
and the text is the accent color.
When it is on, the button background color is the accent color
and the text is white.

The `Toggle` initializer takes a `String` to render
(either before the switch or inside the button)
and a binding to a `Bool` value.

```swift
Toggle("Hungry", isOn: $hungry).toggleStyle(SwitchToggleStyle(tint: .red))

Toggle("Hungry", isOn: $hungry).toggleStyle(.button)
```

<img alt="SwiftUI Toggle" style="width: 60%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Toggle.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI Toggle">

### `Slider`

This renders a horizontal track with a thumb that
slides between minimum and maximum values.
The current value must have the type `Float`, not `Int`.
Text and/or icons can be displayed at the leading and trailing ends.

<img alt="SwiftUI Slider" style="width: 60%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Slider.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI Slider">

```swift
// No text or icons at ends.
Slider(value: $rating, in: 0...10, step: 1)

// Has text at ends and displays current value below.
VStack {
    Slider(
        value: $rating,
        in: 0...10,
        step: 1,
        label: { Text("Rating") }, // not rendered
        // The next two attributes must be closures that return the
        // same kind of view.  Image and Text are common choices.
        minimumValueLabel: { Image(systemName: "hand.thumbsdown") },
        maximumValueLabel: { Image(systemName: "hand.thumbsup") }
    ).padding()
    Text("rating = \(Int(rating))")
}
```

### `Stepper`

This displays "-" and "+" buttons that can be
tapped to decrement and increment a value.
It takes a label to display before the buttons,
a binding for the current value,
an optional range the value must remain inside, and
a closure to execute every time the `Stepper` changes the value.

<img alt="SwiftUI Stepper" style="width: 60%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Stepper.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI Stepper">

```swift
VStack {
    Stepper(
        "# of Dogs: \(dogCount)",
        value: $dogCount,
        in: 0...10
    ) { v in
        tooManyDogs = dogCount > 2
    }

    Text("Too Many Dogs? \(String(tooManyDogs))")
}.padding()
```

### `Picker`

This allows selecting an option from a list.
It takes the text to display as a prompt and a `selection` argument
which is a binding that holds something to identify the selected value.

The `pickerStyle` view modifier can be applied
to change the way the options are rendered.
The specified prompt is only rendered by some styles.
The values that can be passed to this include:

- `.automatic` (default)

  This selects a style based on the context in which the `Picker` is used.
  It is typically either `.menu` or `.wheel`.
  When the `Picker` is inside a `Form` which is inside a `NavigationView`
  and no `pickerStyle` is specified,
  clicking the `Picker` displays the options on a separate page.

      title="SwiftUI Picker automatic after clicking">
    <figcaption>automatic picker new page after clicking</figcaption>
  </figure>

- `.inline`

  This displays the prompt and all the options (visible simultaneously)
  in the current sheet.
  The selected option is indicated by a check mark.
  This works when the `Picker` is inside a `Form`.
  Otherwise it uses the `.wheel` style.

- `.menu`

  This does not display the prompt and
  only displays the currently selected value.
  When the current value is tapped, all the options are
  rendered in a dropdown menu inside the current sheet.
  There is no limit to the number of options that can appear in the menu
  and it will scroll vertically if they do not all fit on the screen.

      title="SwiftUI Picker menu after clicking">
    <figcaption>menu picker after clicking</figcaption>
  </figure>

- `.radioGroup` - not available in iOS

- `.segmented`

  This does not display the prompt,
  and renders the options as a "Segmented Control"
  which is a horizontal row of buttons.
  There is no limit to the number of options,
  but their text will be elided if it doesn't fit inside the buttons.

  <figure>
    <img alt="SwiftUI Picker segmented"
      src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Picker-segmented.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
      title="SwiftUI Picker segmented">
    <figcaption>segmented picker</figcaption>
  </figure>

- `.wheel`

  This does not display the prompt,
  and renders all the options as a scrollable wheel.
  It requires sufficient vertical space to render properly.
  A height of 300 works well.

  <figure>
    <img alt="SwiftUI Picker wheel"
      src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Picker-wheel.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
      title="SwiftUI Picker wheel">
    <figcaption>wheel picker</figcaption>
  </figure>

The font and background colors used by a `Picker`
can be customized in limited ways.

To set the background color, apply the `background` view modifier
to the `Picker`. For example, `.background(Color.yellow.opacity(0.3))`.

To set the font and foreground color, apply the `font` and `foregroundColor`
view modifiers to the `Text` views used to render the options.
For example, `.font(.headline).foregroundColor(.red)`.
This only applies to `automatic` and `wheel` pickers,
not `menu` or `segmented` pickers.

When the options are generated using `ForEach` iterating over an array,
the selected value is described by the `id` property values
of the array elements.
This can be changed by specifying a `tag` value for each option.
The type of the `tag` values must match the type of the `selection` argument.
If these types differ, it will not be possible to select an option.

```swift
@State private var shirtSize: ShirtSize = .sm

enum ShirtSize: String, CaseIterable {
    case sm = "Small"
    case md = "Medium"
    case lg = "Large"
    case xl = "Extra Large"
}

var body: some View {
    Picker("Shirt Size", selection: $shirtSize) {
        ForEach(ShirtSize.allCases, id: \.self) { size in
            Text("\(size.rawValue)").tag(size)
        }
    } // .pickerStyle(.segmented)
}
```

Here's a more complex example where the `Picker` begins
with no option being selected.
Assume that `people` is an array of `Person` objects
that have an optional `name` property.

```swift
@State private var selectedPersonIndex: Int = -1 // nothing selected

private var selectedPerson: Person? {
    selectedPersonIndex == -1 ? nil : people[selectedPersonIndex]
}

...

Picker("Owner", selection: $selectedPersonIndex) {
    ForEach(people.indices) { index in
        Text(people[index].name ?? "").tag(index)
    }
}
```

### `DatePicker`

This allows selecting a date, time, or both.

```swift
DatePicker(
    "Birthday",
    selection: $birthday, // a binding
    displayedComponents: [.date, .hourAndMinute] // array or single value
)
```

To hide the label, pass an empty string
and call the `labelsHidden` view modifier.

```swift
DatePicker("", selection: $birthday, displayedComponents: .date)
    .labelsHidden()
```

Apply the `datePickerStyle` view modifier to choose a style.
The options that can be passed to this include:

- `.automatic` - This is the default and is the same as `.compact` in iOS.

- `.compact` - This renders date in a button that can be tapped
  to render the `.graphical` controls (see below) for changing the date.

  <figure>
    <img alt="SwiftUI DatePicker compact style"
      src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-DatePicker-compact1.png?v={{pkg.version}}"

      title="SwiftUI DatePicker compact style after tapping month-year">
    <figcaption>DatePicker compact style after tapping </figcaption>
  </figure>

- `.field` - This not available in iOS.

- `.graphical` - The renders a calendar view that contains controls for
  picking a month and year, going to the previous or next month,
  and selecting a day of the month.

  <figure>
    <img alt="SwiftUI DatePicker graphical style"
      src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-DatePicker-graphical.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
      title="SwiftUI DatePicker graphical style">
    <figcaption>DatePicker graphical style</figcaption>
  </figure>

- `.stepperField` - This not available in iOS.

- `.wheel` - This provides separate wheel pickers for month, day, and year.

  <figure>
    <img alt="SwiftUI DatePicker wheel style"
      src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-DatePicker-wheel.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
      title="SwiftUI DatePicker wheel style">
    <figcaption>DatePicker wheel style</figcaption>
  </figure>

### `ColorPicker`

This renders a color well for displaying a currently selected color
and changing the color using the system color picker.

<figure>
  <img alt="SwiftUI ColorPicker before tap"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-ColorPicker1.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI ColorPicker before tap">
  <figcaption>ColorPicker before tap</figcaption>

    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-ColorPicker2.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI ColorPicker after tap">
  <figcaption>ColorPicker after tap</figcaption>
</figure>

```swift
ColorPicker(
    "Favorite Color",
    selection: $favoriteColor // a binding
)
```

### `Label`

This is a combination of an icon and text
where the icon appears before the text.
It takes a String for the text and an `systemImage` string
that is the name of an icon in SF Symbols.
By default both the icon and the text are displayed.
To render only the text, add the modifier `.labelStyle(TitleOnlyLabelStyle)`.
To render only the icon, add the modifier `.labelStyle(IconOnlyLabelStyle)`.

```swift
Label("Rain", systemImage: "cloud.rain")
```

### `ProgressView`

This displays a progress indicator.
The indeterminate style uses the standard Apple spinner.
The determinate style uses a thin progress bar.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var progress = 0.0

    func startTimer() {
        // Run every 3 hundredths of a second.
        // When "repeats" is false, this is like setTimeout in JavaScript.
        // When "repeats" is true, this is like setInterval in JavaScript.
        Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.03, repeats: true) { timer in
            progress += 0.01
            if (progress >= 1) {
                timer.invalidate() // stops Timer
                progress = 0
            }
        }
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if progress > 0 {
                ProgressView() // indeterminate
                ProgressView(value: progress).padding() // determinate
            }
        }
        .onAppear { startTimer() }
    }
}
```

### `Gauge`

This shows a current value in relation to minimum and maximum values.
One example is a car fuel gauge.
This is currently only supported in watchOS.

### `EmptyView`

This renders nothing. It is useful in cases where
a view needs to be returned, but there is nothing to display.

### `EquatableView`

TODO: What is this?

### `AnyView`

TODO: What is this?

### `TupleView`

TODO: What is this?

## Fonts

The `font` view modifier specifies the font, size, and weight
to be used in a view.
This is typically applied to `Text` views and
`Image` views that display an SF Symbol icon.

Here are examples of using the default system font:

```swift
Text("Hello").font(.system(size: 24, weight: .bold))
Image(systemName: "cloud.snow").font(.system(size: 64))
```

Another option is to use dynamic fonts whose size changes
based on user preferences.
The dynamic font names, from largest to smallest size, are:

- largeTitle
- title
- title2
- title3
- headline // same size as .body but bold
- body
- callout
- subheadline
- footnote
- caption
- caption2

Users can scale the dynamic fonts used in all apps from
Settings ... Display & Brightness ... Text Size.
Move the slider to one of the seven options.
The middle option (4th one) is the default.
The screenshots below show all the dynamic fonts in the largest (1st option),
default (4th option), and smallest (7th option) text sizes.

<img alt="SwiftUI large dynamic fonts" style="width: 30%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-dynamic-fonts-large.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI large dynamic fonts">

<img alt="SwiftUI small dynamic fonts" style="width: 30%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-dynamic-fonts-small.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI small dynamic fonts">

Fonts can be scaled even larger using an accessibility option.
Select Settings ... Accessibility ... Display & Text Size ... Larger Text.
Enable "Larger Accessibility Sizes" and move the slider to one of the 12 options.
The screenshot below shows all the dynamic fonts in the largest possible
accessibility size.

<img alt="SwiftUI accessibility dynamic fonts" style="width: 30%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-dynamic-fonts-accessibility.jpg?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI accessibility dynamic fonts">

In apps that use dynamic fonts, test all screens at various font size
preferences to verify that the resulting layout is acceptable.

## Floating Action Button

SwiftUI does not provide a floating action button view.
This is a circular button that hovers of the content of a screen.
They typically appear in the lower-right or lower-left corner of the screen.
Floating action buttons are popular in Android applications.

The following code demonstrates one way to
implement a floating action button in SwiftUI:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct FloatingActionButton: View {
    var label: String = "+"
    var action: () -> Void

    let diameter: CGFloat = 70
    let shadow: CGFloat = 3

    var body: some View {
        Button(
            action: action,
            label: {
                ZStack(alignment: .center) {
                    Circle()
                        .background(Color.blue)
                        .frame(width: diameter, height: diameter)
                    Text(label)
                        .font(.system(size: 60))
                        .foregroundColor(.white)
                        .padding(.bottom, 7)
                        .frame(height: diameter)
                }
            }
        )
        .cornerRadius(diameter / 2)
        .padding(.trailing, 35)
        .shadow(
            color: .black.opacity(0.3),
            radius: shadow,
            x: shadow,
            y: shadow
        )
    }
}

struct FloatingActionButton_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ZStack(alignment: .bottomTrailing) {
            Color.yellow.ignoresSafeArea()
            FloatingActionButton() {
                print("got tap")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Combining Container and Component Views

The following code demonstrates using both container and component views.
Note how views can be defined in computed properties
that are later referenced to render them.
The type of these computed properties can be a specific container view type
or the generic type `some View`.
Custom views can also be defined in a new struct that inherits from `View`
Instances of these structs can be created to render them.

```swift
// This defines a custom View that is used below.
struct MyRow: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Text("Six")
            Text("Seven")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    // This assigns a View to a computed property.
    var row = HStack {
        Text("Four")
        Text("Five")
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("One")
            HStack {
                Text("Two")
                Text("Three")
            }
            // This refers to a variable to get a View
            // and chains View modifiers onto it.
            row.padding().border(.red)
            MyRow() // This creates a custom View instance.
        }
    }
}
```

Note how `ContentView` uses the view `MyRow`.
It is preferred to create small views like this and compose them
rather than creating views whose code is long and deeply nested.

## Drawing Views

The `Shape` protocol inherits from the `View` protocol
and there are many provided views that inherit from `Shape`.
Examples include `Circle` and `Rectangle`.

By default, all views that inherit from `Shape` are
filled with the foreground color of their parent view.
This can be changed using the `fill` view modifier.
It takes an object of a type that implements the `ShapeStyle` protocol.
Examples include `Color`, `AngularGradient`, `LinearGradient`,
`RadialGradient`, and `ImagePaint`.

An outline can be added to any `Shape` with the `.stroke` view modifier.

Many of these views support both the `border` and `strokeBorder` view modifiers.
The difference between these becomes apparent
when the border width is greater than one.
`border` is drawn so it is centered on the edge of the shape
with half inside and half outside.
`strokeBorder` is drawn so none of the border is outside of the shape.

The following example code draws several shapes:

<img alt="SwiftUI Shapes" style="width: 40%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Shapes.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI Shapes">

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    let linearGradient = LinearGradient(
        gradient: Gradient(colors: [.red, .yellow]),
        startPoint: .leading, // other values are .top and .bottom
        endPoint: .trailing
    )
    let angularGradient = AngularGradient(
        // It's usually best to return to the starting color.
        gradient: Gradient(colors: [.yellow, .blue, .yellow]),
        center: .center,
        startAngle: .degrees(90),
        endAngle: .degrees(90 + 360)
    )
    let radialGradient = RadialGradient(
        gradient: Gradient(colors: [.red, .yellow]),
        center: .center,
        startRadius: 0,
        endRadius: 20
    )

    func radialGradient(over size: CGSize) -> RadialGradient {
        let diameter = min(size.width, size.height)
        let radius = diameter / 2;
        return RadialGradient(
            // Colors go from inside to outside.
            gradient: Gradient(colors: [.white, .yellow, .red]),
            center: .center,
            startRadius: 0,
            endRadius: radius
        )
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ZStack {
                Capsule().fill(.red)
                Text("Capsule with solid color")
            }
            ZStack {
                GeometryReader { geometry in
                    Circle().fill(radialGradient(over: geometry.size))
                }
                Text("Circle\nwith\nRadialGradient")
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
            }
            ZStack {
                Ellipse().fill(angularGradient)
                Text("Ellipse with AngularGradient")
            }
            ZStack {
                Rectangle().fill(linearGradient)
                Text("Rectangle with LinearGradient")
            }
            ZStack {
                RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 10)
                    .fill(ImagePaint(image: Image("Comet"), scale: 0.34))
                Text("RoundedRectangle with ImagePaint")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .foregroundColor(.purple)
            }
        }.padding()
    }
}
```

### `Angle`

This is a struct that does not implement the `View` protocol,
but is used by several drawing views.
Instances can be created using an initializer
that takes either a `degrees` or a `radians` argument.
The value can be obtained via either `degrees` or `radians` properties
and conversions are performed automatically.

```swift
let angle = Angle(radians: Double.pi)
print(angle.degrees) // 180.0
```

### `Path`

Like `Color`, `Path` also creates a view.
The following example draws a path for a triangle
that is both filled and stroked.

<img alt="SwiftUI Path" style="width: 40%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Path.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI Path">

```swift
// Define the path as a computed property so it can be
// used once for filling and once for stroking.
var path: Path {
    Path { path in
        path.move(to: CGPoint(x: 0, y: width))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: halfWidth, y: 0))
        path.addLine(to: CGPoint(x: width, y: width))
        path.closeSubpath()
    }
}

// Inside some container view ...
ZStack {
    path.fill(.yellow)
    path.stroke(
        .red,
        style: StrokeStyle(
            lineWidth: lineWidth,
            lineCap: .round,
            lineJoin: .round
        )
    )
}
```

The `Path` view supports many drawing methods including:
`addArc`, `addCurve`, `addEllipse`, `addLines`, `addPath`, `addQuadCurve`,
`addRect`, `addRects`, `addRelativeArc`, and `addRoundedRect`.

### Other Drawing Views

Many drawing views draw exactly what their name implies.
These include `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `Rectangle`,
and `RoundedRectangle` (has rounded corners).

Other drawing views are less obvious from their name, including:

- `Anchor`: ?
- `AnimatablePair`: ?
- `Animation`: ?
- `AnyShapeShape`: ?
- `AnyTransition`: ?
- `Capsule`: draws an oval
- `ContainerRelativeShape`: ?
- `EmptyAnimatableData`: ?
- `OffsetShape`: ?
- `ProjectionTransform`: ?
- `RotatedShape`: ?
- `ScaledShape`: ?
- `TransformedShape`: ?
- `UnitPoint`: ?

## Other Views

### `GeometryReader`

This is a view that takes all the space offered to it, wraps other views,
and provides its size which can be used in calculations.
The size is passed to a trailing closure and has the type `GeometryProxy`
which has a `size` property whose type is `CGSize`.

The following example gets the size of a `VStack` and displays it inside.

<img alt="SwiftUI GeometryReader" style="width: 40%"
    src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-GeometryReader.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
    title="SwiftUI GeometryReader">

```swift
VStack(spacing: 0) {
    // The 3 children below are given equal heights.
    Rectangle().fill(.red)
    GeometryReader { geometry in
        VStack() {
            Text("width = \(geometry.size.width)")
            Text("height = \(geometry.size.height)")
        }
        // This expands the size of the VStack to fill the
        // GeometryReader so the contents are centered.
        .frame(width: geometry.size.width,
            height: geometry.size.height)
         }
    Rectangle().fill(.blue)
}
```

### `Spacer`

Each `Spacer` view takes an equal amount of the unused space
inside its parent container view.
It accepts an optional `minLength` attribute which defaults to zero.

Using `Spacer` can be compared to web applications that use
the CSS properties `display: flex;` and `justify-content`
with the values shown in the following table:

| CSS justify-content value | Spacer placement              |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| flex-start                | at end of list of views       |
| flex-end                  | at beginning of list of views |
| space-between             | one between each child view   |

### `Divider`

This draws a light gray, 1-pixel wide line across the container.
The line is vertical in an `HStack` and horizontal in a `VStack`.

The line can be customized in several ways:

- To add space around the line, use the `padding` view modifier.

  ```swift
  Divider().padding(20)
  ```

- To change the color of the line, use the `background` view modifier.

  ```swift
  Divider().background(.red)
  ```

- To draw a thicker line, use the `frame` modifier.
  This doesn't actually make the `Divider` thicker,
  it just makes the area allocated wider and fills it with a color.

  ```swift
  Divider().background(.blue).frame(height: 20).background(.blue)
  ```

- To avoid drawing the line all the way across the container,
  use the `frame` view modifier and specify the `maxWidth` attribute.

  ```swift
  Divider().frame(maxWidth: 200)
  ```

## AttributedString

The `AttributedString` struct supports associating specific "attributes"
with substrings in a `String` that it holds.
For example, the string "Red Green Blue" can have attributes
that specify the foreground color to use for each word.
When rendered, it can apply the attributes to affect styling.

For basic styling such as making parts of a string bold or italic,
it is not necessary to use `AttributedString` because
the `Text` view supports a subset of Markdown syntax.
However, this only works when a literal `String` is passed.
To pass a variable of type `String` that contains Markdown syntax,
use `Text(.init(myVariable))`.

There are several approaches that can be used to associate attributes
with substrings in an `AttributedString` instance.
Adding extension methods to `AttributedString` and `Text`
greatly simplifies this.

## Layout Details

Container views offer space to their child views.
The child views can choose their size within the space offered to them.
Container views then position the contained views knowing their sizes.
Container views can also then choose their own size
that perhaps differs from they offered to their child views.

Some views are "inflexible" and want to be a specific size.
Examples including `Text` and `Image` views.
Other views are "flexible" and can adapt to the space offered to them.
Examples include `Circle` and `RoundedRectangle`.

Container views give space to inflexible child views first and
then divide the remaining space between the flexible child views.
The priority with which container views give space to child views
can be altered by applying the `layoutPriority` view modifier to child views.
It is passed a float value that defaults to zero.

When a container view contains at least one flexible view,
it is also considered to be flexible.

Unsafe areas, such as the area at the top of iPhones that have a camera bump,
are removed from offered space by default.
Sometimes it is useful to draw in those areas.
One example, shown below, is displaying a background image.

<img alt="SwiftUI Unsafe Areas" style="width: 40%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-UnsafeAreas.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI Unsafe Areas">

```swift
VStack {
    Spacer()
    Text("Comet the Whippet")
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .font(.system(size: 36))
    Spacer()
}
    .background(Image("Comet").resizable().scaledToFill())
    .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all) // allows drawing in unsafe areas
```

## Event Handling

Views support many methods whose names begin with "on"
to register a function to be called when a given event occurs.
These include:

- `onTapGesture`
- `onLongPressGesture`

- `onDrag`
- `onDrop`

- `onAppear`

  This takes a function to execute every time
  the view on which it is applied is rendered.

- `onDisappear`

- `onCommand`
- `onCopyCommand`
- `onCutCommand`
- `onDeleteCommand`
- `onExitCommand`
- `onMoveCommand`
- `onPasteCommand`
- `onPlayPauseCommand`

- `onChange`
- `onContinueUserActivity`
- `onHover`
- `onOpenURL`
- `onReceive`
- `onSubmit`

## Environment

SwiftUI provides many values to all views through the "environment".
Any view in the view hierarchy can access environment data
using the `@Environment` property wrapper.

Highlights of environment data include:

- `accessibilityReduceMotion: Bool`

  This captures the user preference for reducing motion.
  It can be used to determine the kinds of animations that should be used.

- `colorScheme: ColorScheme`

  This is an `enum` with the cases `light` and `dark`.

- `defaultWheelPickerItemHeight: CGFloat`

  This can be used to calculate the `frame` height needed for a wheel picker.

- `managedObjectContext: NSManagedObjectContext`

  This holds the context being used for Core Data.

- `locale: Locale`

  This holds the current locale which can be used for internationalization.

- `editMode: EditMode`

  This indicates whether the user can currently edit view content.
  It is an `enum` with the cases `active`, `inactive`,
  and `transient` (temporary edit mode).

- `font: Font?`

  This describes the default font.

It is also possible to add custom data to the environment.
Any view below the view where the environment data is added can access it.

The following example demonstrates this by adding
the custom environment value "primaryColor".
Environment values provided by Apple are accessed and modified in the same way.

```swift
import SwiftUI

// Define a custom environment key and its default value.
private struct PrimaryColorKey: EnvironmentKey {
    static let defaultValue = Color.red
}

// Add the custom environment value.
extension EnvironmentValues {
    var primaryColor: Color {
        get { self[PrimaryColorKey.self] }
        set { self[PrimaryColorKey.self] = newValue }
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @Environment(\.primaryColor) var primaryColor

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Renders in blue.
            Text("in ChildView").foregroundColor(primaryColor)
            GrandchildView()
        }
    }
}

struct GrandchildView: View {
    @Environment(\.primaryColor) var primaryColor

    var body: some View {
        // Renders in blue.
        Text("in GrandchildView").foregroundColor(primaryColor)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(\.primaryColor) var primaryColor

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            // Renders in red when run in the Simulator
            // and in green when run in Preview.
            Text("in ContentView").foregroundColor(primaryColor)
            // Override the default value of primaryColor
            // for all views under ChildView.
            ChildView().environment(\.primaryColor, .blue)

        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        // Override the default value of primaryColor for entire app.
        ContentView().environment(\.primaryColor, .green)
    }
}
```

## Search

SwiftUI provides a search input containing a magnifier glass icon
that is rendered by the `searchable` view modifier.
This is typically applied to a `List` view.

The following code demonstrates filtering a `List`
using the `searchable` view modifier.

<img alt="SwiftUI Search" style="width: 50%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-Search.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI Search">

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var query = ""

    private let people = [
        "Mark",
        "Tami",
        "Amanda",
        "Jeremy",
        "Meghan",
        "RC"
    ]

    // Computed property based on people and query.
    private var matchingPeople: [String] {
        let lower = query.lowercased()
        return lower.isEmpty ?
            people :
            people.filter { $0.lowercased().contains(lower) }
    }

    // This is rebuilt when the value of query changes.
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(matchingPeople, id: \.self) { person in
                Text(person)
            }
            .searchable(
                text: $query,
                // Without this the search input will be hidden
                // until the user drags down on the List.
                placement: .navigationBarDrawer(displayMode: .always),
                prompt: "Person Name"
            )
            .autocapitalization(.none)
            .navigationTitle("People")
        }
    }
}
```

## Lists

A `List` view displays a list of other views in a single column.
It also can act like `ForEach` for iterating over array elements.

If a `List` contains more items that can be rendered at once,
it automatically provides scrolling.
There is no need to wrap it in a `ScrollView`.

The contents of a `List` can be any views.
These can be grouped using `Section` views.

<img alt="SwiftUI List with Sections" style="width: 40%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-List-Sections.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI List with Sections">

```swift
List {
    Section("Breakfast") {
        Text("pancakes")
        Text("bacon")
        Text("orange juice")
    }
    Section("Lunch") {
        Text("sandwich")
        Text("chips")
        Text("lemonade")
    }
    Section("Dinner") {
        Text("spaghetti")
        Text("bread")
        Text("water")
    }
}
//.listStyle(.grouped) // for edge-to-edge display
```

The following example demonstrates using a `List` inside a `NavigationView`
to enable selecting ids of the objects represented by the rows.
To select rows, tap "Edit" in the upper-right corner.

This also demonstrates implementing "pull to refresh"
using the `refreshable` view modifier.
Dragging the list down displays an activity indicator
and then adds new dogs to the list.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    struct Dog: CustomStringConvertible, Identifiable, Hashable {
        let id = UUID()
        let name: String
        let breed: String
        var description: String { "\(name) - \(breed)" }
    }

    @State private var dogs = [

        Dog(name: "Ramsay", breed: "Native American Indian Dog"),
        Dog(name: "Oscar", breed: "German Shorthaired Pointer"),
        Dog(name: "Comet", breed: "Whippet")
    ]

    //@State private var selection: UUID? // single selection
    @State private var selectedIds = Set<UUID>() // multiple selection

    func loadMore() async {
        // This calls a REST service that returns nothing after 2 seconds.
        let url = URL(string: "https://httpbin.org/delay/2")!
        let request = URLRequest(url: url)
        // Not using the return value for this example.
        let _ = try! await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)

        dogs.append(Dog(name: "Clarice", breed: "Whippet"))
        dogs.append(Dog(name: "Vixen", breed: "Whippet"))
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            NavigationView {
                List(dogs, selection: $selectedIds) { dog in
                    let desc = String(describing: dog)
                    if selectedIds.contains(where: {$0 == dog.id}) {
                        Text(desc).bold().foregroundColor(.green)
                    } else {
                        Text(desc)
                    }
                }
                .navigationTitle("Dogs")
                // The EditButton in the toolbar toggles
                // the edit mode of the NavigationView.
                .toolbar { EditButton() }
            }.refreshable { await loadMore() }
            Text("\(selectedIds.count) selections")
        }
    }
}
```

The following example is similar to the previous one,
but allows rows to be deleted and moved.
It seems that it isn't possible for a `List` to support
row selection and also support deleting and moving rows.

## Animation

Many view properties can be animated.
These include color, opacity, rotation, and scale.
Note that font sizes cannot be animated,
but views containing text can be scaled.

SwiftUI supports three ways of implementing animations.

- explicit: wraps code that changes a model or `@State` data
  with a call to `withAnimation`
- implicit: uses the `animation` view modifier
- transition: triggers when a view is inserted or removed

Explicit animations are the most commonly used
because they are triggered by model/state changes
which are typically made in response to user interactions.
These can cause multiple views to animate concurrently.
For example, the action of a `Button` can wrap calls to
ViewModel intent functions in a closure passed to `withAnimation`.
Most code that handles user events does this.

Key points to remember when implementing animations:

1. Only changes to view modifier arguments and shapes are animated.
2. Only views that are already on the screen
   are affected by explicit and implicit animations.
3. The `animation` view modifier applies to
   all view modifiers chained before it, but not to those chained after it.
4. Explicit animations do not override or prevent implicit animations.
   Both can be applied concurrently.
5. Animations are automatically and smoothly interrupted by new animations.

One way to achieve point #2 is to leave views on the screen permanently,
but conditionally hide them by setting their opacity to zero.
For example, `myView.opacity(show ? 1 : 0)`.

Animations can specify a duration (in seconds), delay, easing function,
and number of times to repeat.
Duration is the total time over which the animation takes place.
Delay is the amount of time the animation waits to begin after being triggered.
An easing function controls the speed at which an animation advances
over its duration.

Provided easing functions include
`linear`, `easeIn`, `easeOut`, `easeInOut` (default), and `spring`.
These are static functions on the `Animation` struct.
All but `spring` take a single, optional argument
which is the `duration` in seconds.
The `spring` function takes three optional arguments named
`response`, `dampingFunction`, and `blendDuration`.
For details, see the {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/spring(response:dampingfraction:blendduration:)",
"spring method" %}.

Custom easing functions can be defined with the {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/animation/timingcurve(_:_:_:_:duration:)",
"timingCurve" %} function.

The following example provides form elements
for experimenting with different kinds of animations.

                            borderColor =
                                borderColor == .red ? .blue : .red
                        }
                        on.toggle()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Transitions can be applied to any kind of view including container views.
They are specified when a view is defined,
but they are only applied when the view is inserted or removed.
This is implemented by using an `if` or `switch` statement inside a parent view.

By default an `opacity` transition (fade) is used.
This can be changed by applying the `transition` view modifier
which is passed the kind of transition to perform.
Transitions are defined as methods on the `AnyTransition` struct.

Typically the provided `opacity`, `scale`, and `slide` transitions are used.
The `identity` transition is used to specify that no transition should occur.
Custom transitions can also be implemented.

By default the transition is reversed when the view is removed.
For example, `opacity` changes from 0 to 1 when the view is inserted,
and from 1 to 0 when it is removed.
This can be changed using the `asymmetric` transition function
which allows specifying one transition for insertion
and a different one for removal.

Most insertion transitions do not currently work in Preview,
but they do work in the Simulator.
However, the Simulator often displays odd rendering artifacts.

The following example demonstrates sliding a view
in from the top when it is inserted and
out to the right when it is removed.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var include = false

    let easeFn = Animation.easeInOut(duration: 1)

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            VStack {
                if include {
                    Text("Conditionally Included")
                        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity) // use full screen width

                        // This slides in from left and out to right.
                        //.transition(.slide)

                        // The animation call here should apply the
                        // easing function when one is not specified
                        // in the call to withAnimation, but it doesn't work.
                        //.transition(.slide.animation(easeFn))

                        .transition(.asymmetric(
                            insertion: .move(edge: .top),
                            removal: .move(edge: .trailing)
                        ))

                        // This changes scale from 0 to 1 for insertion
                        // and 1 to 0 for removal.
                        //.transition(.scale)
                }
            }
            .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, minHeight: 50) // use full width
            .border(.red)

            NavigationView {
                Form {
                    // If a Toggle is used instead of a Button
                    // to toggle the value of "include",
                    // there is no opportunity to use "withAnimation".
                    //Toggle("Include Optional Text?", isOn: $include)

                    Button("Toggle Optional Text") {
                        //withAnimation {
                        withAnimation(easeFn) {
                            include.toggle()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

        }
    }
}
```

The `matchedGeometryEffect` view modifier is used
to smoothly move views between container views.
For example, this can be used to move `Text` views that describe food items
between lists of foods that available and those that have been selected.
Each food item must have a unique id.
When rendering the food items, `matchedGeometryEffect` is used
to associate the `Text` view with a particular id in a given namespace.

The following code demonstrates this:

```swift
struct Food: Identifiable {
    var name: String
    var selected: Bool = false
    var id: String { name }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @Namespace private var foodNS

    @State private var foods: [Food] = [
        Food(name: "Hamburger"),
        Food(name: "Fries"),
        Food(name: "Shake"),
    ]

    func foodList(selected: Bool) -> some View {
        List(foods) { food in
            if food.selected == selected {
                Text(food.name)
                    .matchedGeometryEffect(id: food.id, in: foodNS)
                    .onTapGesture {
                        withAnimation { toggle(food: food) }
                    }
            }
        }
    }

    func toggle(food: Food) {
        let index = foods.firstIndex(where: { $0.id == food.id })!
        foods[index].selected.toggle()
    }

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            VStack {
                Text("Available")
                foodList(selected: false)
            }
            VStack {
                Text("Selected")
                foodList(selected: true)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Camera

To enable camera access in a SwiftUI app:

1. In the Navigator, select the root group to open the project editor.
2. In the project editor, select the target.
3. Select the "Info" tab.
4. Click the "+" after any existing key to create a new key.
5. For the key name enter "Privacy - Camera Usage Description".
6. For the key value, enter a user prompt like "Please allow camera access."

Preview and the Simulator cannot access the camera.
To test camera access, run the app on a real device.

## Scanning QR Codes and Barcodes

The library "CodeScan" makes this easy. The YouTube video
{% aTargetBlank "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3MODOPZINs",
"Scanning QR codes with SwiftUI" %} demonstrates using this.

- Select File ... Add Packages...
- Enter {% aTargetBlank "https://github.com/twostraws/CodeScanner",
  "CodeScanner" %}" in the search input
- Click the "Add Package" button.
- Click the next "Add Package" button.

TODO: Add more detail on using this package.

## Audio

The `AVAudioPlayer` class in the `AVKit` package
can be used to play audio from files with formats like MP3.

A good source of free audio files is
{% aTargetBlank "https://freesoundslibrary.com", "Free Sounds Library" %}.
Download audio files and copy them into an Xcode project next to `.swift` files.

The following example creates buttons
that each play a different sound when tapped.
It relies on having the files `click.mp3` and `ding.mp3`
copied into the project.

```swift
import AVKit
import SwiftUI

class SoundManager {
    static let instance = SoundManager()

    var player: AVAudioPlayer?

    func play(name: String) {
        guard let url =
            Bundle.main.url(forResource: name, withExtension: ".mp3") else {
                print("failed to load audio file \(name)")
                return
            }
        do {
            // Declaring player here does not work.  Why?
            //let player = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url)
            player = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url)
            player?.play()
        } catch {
            print("error playing audio: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Click") {
                SoundManager.instance.play(name: "click")
            }.buttonStyle(.bordered)
            Button("Ding") {
                SoundManager.instance.play(name: "ding")
            }.buttonStyle(.bordered)
        }
    }
}
```

## MVVM

SwiftUI encourages use of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) paradigm
which separates application code into three groups.
This differs from UIKit which encourages use of Model-View-Controller (MVC).

Any state held in a view using the `@State` property modifier
should be transient state such as data related to styling.

Models ...

- holds data and application logic
- have no knowledge of the view code that uses the data
- are structs that typically conform to the `Identifiable` protocol
  which requires having an `id` property (can have an `UUID` value);
  allows iterating over them in a `ForEach` loop

  For a unique `String` value, use `UUID().uuidString`.
  This is useful for inserting in a database.

ViewModels ...

- are classes (not structs) that implement the `ObservableObject` protocol
  (Making them classes allows multiple views
  to share a reference to the same object.)
- should be marked `final` to prevent subclassing and decrease build times
- mark the properties whose values they publish
  with the `@Published` property wrapper which is
  a shorthand for explicitly calling `objectWillChange.send()`
- are passed to views or created inside them and
  held in properties with the `@StateObject` property wrapper
  (which subscribes to ViewModel data)
- have no knowledge of the views that use them
- have methods referred to as "intents"
  that are called by by views to update model data
- optionally create and hold model instances,
  typically in `private` properties
- react to model changes by optionally transforming model data
  and publishing changes

Views ...

- decide what to render
- should be mostly stateless
- are declarative rather than imperative because they describe
  what to render based on the current data, not when to render it
- can be associated with any number of ViewModels
- subscribe to changes in ViewModels by declaring properties
  using the `@ObservedObject` or `@StateObject` property wrapper
- react to changes published by ViewModels by rebuilding their bodies
- have a `body` var that rebuilds the view
  any time there are changes in the data of ViewModels they use
- can call the `onReceive` method to register a function to be called
  when new data is received (I couldn't get this to work.)

For example, a ViewModel could get the result of a SQL query from the Model
and turn it into an array of objects that it publishes to Views.

Read-only data flows from the Model, through the ViewModel, and into the View.
Views call ViewModel functions referred to as "intents"
to notify it about user interactions.
ViewModel methods can trigger Model updates.

Here is a basic example of using MVVM.
It's not exactly MVVM because it combines the Model and ViewModel
into a single class.
This is perhaps acceptable in cases where Model data is
presented as-is to the View without requiring any data transformation.

Note the use of the `@Published` and `@ObservedObject` property wrappers.

## Popovers

Popovers are often used for tooltip or help text.

The following example displays a popover above a `Text` view
when a `Button` is tapped.
On an iPad popovers are rendered like speech bubbles
with a tail pointing at an associated view.
On an iPhone popovers are rendered as sheets that slide in from the bottom.

                // SwiftUI doesn't support showing
                // multiple popovers at the same time.
                // If this is attempted, none will be displayed.
                showHelp = true
                runAfter(seconds: 2) { showHelp = false }
            }
            .buttonStyle(.bordered)
        }
    }
}
```

## Alerts

Alerts are simple modal dialogs that contain
a title, an optional message, and buttons.
They are defined using the `alert` method
that can be chained onto any view.
They are displayed when a given binding is set to true.

The buttons to display are described in the `actions` argument.
Like any button, these can have associated actions.

When there are more than two buttons,
they are stacked vertically.
Otherwise they are placed on one row.

If no buttons are provided, a default "OK" button
with a role of `.cancel` is provided.

            HStack {
                Stepper(

                Text("My Message")
            }
        )
        .alert(
            "Dog Alert",
            isPresented: $tooManyDogs,
            actions: {
                Button("OK") {
                    print("pressed OK")
                }
                Button("Keep") {
                    print("pressed Keep")
                }
            },
            message: {
                // Can only have a single Text view here,
                // not any kind of View!
                Text("You have too many dogs!")
            }
        )
    }
}
```

## Modal Dialogs

Basic modal dialogs can be created using the
`alert` and `confirmationDialog` view modifiers.

Custom modal dialogs are implemented by displaying a "sheet".
The sheet slides in from the bottom by default.

The following example defines the custom view `MyModal`
which is displayed in the sheet.
Custom views, like any struct, can have properties
that are passed in when instances are created.
The `ContentView` struct declares the boolean property `showModal`
and passes it to the `MyModal` struct as a binding.
This allows the action of the "Close" button in `MyModal`
to set it to `false` which hides the sheet.

## Toolbars

Toolbars are collections of buttons that can be
displayed at the top or bottom of the display.
The are created by applying the `toolbar` view modifier
to the top view inside a `NavigationView`.
Single buttons can be described inside a `ToolbarItem` view.
Multiple buttons can be described inside a `ToolbarItemGroup` view.

If there are only two buttons in a toolbar,
they are laid out as if there is a `Spacer` between them.
For other layouts, add your own `Spacer` views.

The placement of a toolbar is specified by the `placement` attribute
in the `ToolbarItem` and `ToolbarItemGroup` views.
Supported `placement` values include:

- `.navigationBarLeading`: top, left-justified
- `.navigationBarTrailing`: top, right-justified
- `.bottomBar`: bottom, centered

Other `placement` values seem to be unable to render multiple buttons.

                        Spacer()
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
```

## Navigation

The `NavigationView` view marks the spot where
the views associated with `NavigationLinks` will be rendered.
The example below renders four pages.
Page 1 contains links to pages 2 and 3.
Page 3 contains a link to page 4.

<img alt="SwiftUI NavigationLink page 1" style="width: 24%"
  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-navigation-page1.png?v={{pkg.version}}"

  src="/blog/assets/SwiftUI-navigation-page4.png?v={{pkg.version}}"
  title="SwiftUI NavigationLink page 4">

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct Page1: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("This is page one.")
                .navigationTitle("Page 1")
                .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
                // .large leaves a large amount of space above
            Spacer()
            HStack {
                NavigationLink(destination: Page2()) {
                    Text("Page 2")
                }
                NavigationLink(destination: Page3()) {
                    Text("Page 3")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Page2: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is page two.").navigationTitle("Page 2")
    }
}

struct Page3: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("This is page three.").navigationTitle("Page 3")
            Spacer()
            NavigationLink(destination: Page4()) {
                Text("Page 4")
            }
        }
    }
}

struct Page4: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("This is page four.").navigationTitle("Page 4")
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Page1()
        }
    }
}
```

If the view inside a `NavigationLink` doesn't have a `navigationTitle`,
the link to go back will just display "Back".

To go back to the previous view programmatically,
add the following to a view and call `dismiss` with no arguments.

```swift
@Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
```

Here is a more advanced example of using `NavigationView`.

Most SwiftUI code works on all platforms.
However, watchOS does not support `NavigationView`.
Here is a shim that provides a shell implementation
so the same code that works in iOS can work in watchOS.

To run this app as a watchOS app in the simulator:

- select File ... New ... Target
- click the watchOS tab
- scroll down and select "Watch App for iOS App"
- click Next
- enter a product name
- click Finish, then Activate

TODO: Why does the Apple Watch Simulator always just display "Hello, World!"
and not what is in this app?

```swift
#if os(watchOS)
struct NavigationView<Content: View>: View {
    let content: () -> Content

    init(@ViewBuilder content: @escaping () -> Content) {
        self.content = content
    }

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 0) {
            content()
        }
    }
}
#endif
```

macOS does not support the `navigationBarTitle` view modifier.
Here is a shim that provides a shell implementation
so the same code that works in iOS can work in macOS.

To run this app as a macOS app in the Simulator,
create the app as either a Multiplatform App or a macOS app.

```swift
#if os(macOS)
extension View {
    func navigationBarTitle(_ title: String) -> some View {
        self
    }
}
#endif
```

## Sidebars

A sidebar provides app-level navigation to top-level collections of content.
For example, the iOS Mail app displays a list of mailboxes in a sidebar.
Selecting an item in the sidebar changes what is displayed
in the pane that follows.

SwiftUI creates a sidebar when the `.listStyle(.sidebar)` view modifier
is applied to a `List` view.

The following example uses a sidebar for selecting a sport.
When a sport is selected, the pane to its right
displays a list of teams in that sport and allows one to be selected.
When a team is selected, the pane to its right
displays a list of players on that team.

## Utility Functions

The {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/1539127-dump", "dump" %}
function takes a value and prints it for debugging purposes.
The value can be non-primitive such as an object or array.
Optional arguments that follow the value include
`name`, `indent`, `maxDepth`, and `maxItems`.

## Key Paths

A {% aTargetBlank "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY7SlOklZzk",
"key path" %} refers to a property in a struct or class rather than
the value of a property in a particular instance.

A key path can be created with a backslash followed by
a type name, a period, and a property name.
For example:

```swift
struct Person {
  var name: String
}

let namePath = \Person.name
```

Key paths can also refer to deeply nested properties.
For example, if the `Person` struct contained an `address` property
that referred to an `Address` struct that contained a `country` property
then the key path `\Person.address.country` would refer to it.

A key path can be used to get the value of a property
from an instance of a struct or class. For example:

```swift
let person = Person(name: "Mark")
let name = person[keyPath: namePath] // "Mark"
```

All objects have the property `self` that refers to the whole object.
To write a key path that refers to the whole object
rather than a specific property inside it, use `\.self`.

## Environments

A SwiftUI environment specifies key/value pairs that available
in (and can effect) all sub-views of the view on which they are specified.
For example, if a font is specified on a `VStack` then it
becomes the default font for all views nested inside it at any depth.

To dump the contents on the current environment of a view,
chain the following onto the view:

```swift
.transformEnvironment(\.self) { dump($0) }
```

TODO: Watch this {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUiITSkAqAo&t=548s", "video" %}.

## Device ID

To get the unique ID of the current device:

```swift
if let uuid = UIDevice.current.identifierForVendor?.uuidString {
    // use uuid
}
```

## Network Requests

See the "HTTP" section in my blog page on Swift.

TODO: Watch this {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NowSN4qJUY&t=729s", "video" %}.

## UserDefaults

The `UserDefaults` class is "an interface to the user's defaults database,
where you store key-value pairs persistently across launches of your app."
When an app is deleted, it's `UserDefaults` data is also deleted.

The `@AppStorage` property wrapper makes it easier to work with `UserDefaults`,
but it is limited to the following types:
`Bool`, `Int`, `Double`, `String`, `URL`, and `Data` (byte buffer).
It can't be used in the example below because
it stores an array of struct instances.
TODO: Can you store an array objects directly without encoding as JSON?

The code below demonstrates using this to persist data about dogs as JSON.

```swift
struct Dog: Codable, CustomStringConvertible, Identifiable {
    var name: String
    var breed: String
    var description: String { "\(name) is a \(breed)"}
    var id: String { name }

    // Can also use this to specify different names for the JSON keys.
    enum CodingKeys: CodingKey {
        case name
        case breed
    }
}

func deleteData(for key: String) {
    UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: key)
}

func getData<T>(for key: String, defaultingTo defaultValue: T) -> T where T: Decodable {
    if let data = UserDefaults.standard.data(forKey: key) {
        if let decoded = try? JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data) {
            return decoded
        }
    }
    return defaultValue
}

func setData<T>(for key: String, to value: T) where T: Encodable {
    if let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(value) {
        UserDefaults.standard.set(encoded, forKey: key)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    private static let KEY = "dogs"

    @State private var breed = ""
    @State private var name = ""
    @State private var dogs: [Dog] // can't initialize this to an empty array!

    init() {
        dogs = getData(for: ContentView.KEY, defaultingTo: [])
        print("init: dogs =", dogs)
    }

    func deleteAll() {
        deleteData(for: ContentView.KEY)
        dogs = []
    }

    func deleteDogs(at offsets: IndexSet) {
        dogs.remove(atOffsets: offsets)
        save()
    }

    func save() {
        setData(for: ContentView.KEY, to: dogs)
    }

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            VStack {
                Section(header: Text("New Dog")) {
                    Form {
                        TextField("Name", text: $name)

                    List {
                        ForEach(dogs) { dog in
                            Text(String(describing: dog))
                        }
                        .onDelete(perform: deleteDogs)
                    }
                    Button("Delete All", action: deleteAll)
                }
                Spacer()
            }.navigationBarTitle("Dog Collection", displayMode: .inline)
        }
    }
}
```

## Combine

From the official docs, "The Combine framework provides
a declarative Swift API for processing values over time.
These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events.
Combine declares publishers to expose values that can change over time,
and subscribers to receive those values from the publishers."

TODO: Watch this {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRpFHqv0tRQ&t=701s" , "video" %}.

## Secrets

Some apps need to use data that should be not be visible to users
and show not be stored in version control systems.
This includes keys and passwords that are required to invoke REST services.
Here is one approach to store these secrets.

1. Create a new file, select the "Other" category,
   and select "Configuration Settings File".
1. Name the file `Secrets.xcconfig`.
1. Add secrets in this file where each line has the format
   `SOME_SECRET_KEY = SOME_SECRET_VALUE`.
1. In the Navigator, select the top project group.
1. In the project editor left nav, select the project.
1. Select the "Info" tab.
1. Under "Configurations", expand the "Debug" and "Release" sections.
1. Register the new file with the app name under each of these
   by clicking "None" and selecting "Secrets".
1. In the project editor left nav, click the target.
1. Open the "Custom iOS Target Properties" section.
1. For each secret
   - Hover over any existing key.
   - Click the "+" to add another property.
   - Enter a key, select a type, and enter a value

Access secret values in code as follows:

```swift
let secretValue = Bundle.main.object(
    forInfoDictionaryKey: "SOME_SECRET_KEY"
) as? String
```

If the secret values used by the release version of the app
need to differ from those used by the debug version,
create a different Configuration Settings File for each
(perhaps with the names `SecretsDebug.xcconfig` and `SecretsRelease.xcconfig`)
and register them appropriately on the 'Info" tab.

Add the Configuration Settings Files to `.gitignore`
to keep them out of version control.
Consider checking in a template Configuration Settings File
that doesn't contain real values
in order to document the secret keys that are required.
In addition, add the generated file `{app-name}-Info.plist` to `.gitignore`.

## Background Tasks

Apple introduced the BackgroundTasks framework in 2019 as part of iOS 13.

See {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/ios-background-task-framework-app-update/",
"How To Use iOS Background Tasks Framework" %}.

To run tasks while an app is in the background:

1. Select the top project entry in the Navigator.
1. Click the top entry under TARGETS
1. Click the "Signing & Capabilities" tab.
1. Click the "+" to add a capability.
1. In the dialog that appears, double-click "Background Modes".
1. Check the checkboxes for "Background fetch" and "Background processing".
1. Click the "Info" tab.
1. Expand the "Custom iOS Target Properties" section if not already expanded.
1. Click the row of the last entry and then click the circled "+" that appears.
1. Add the key "Permitted background task scheduler identifiers"
1. Set the type to "Array".
1. For each background tasks

   1. Click the "+" on that row to add an item.
   1. The item type should be "String".
   1. Set the value to a unique string.
   1. Register a task.

1. Edit the file "AppDelegate.swift".
1. Add `import BackgroundTasks`

## Core Data

Core Data is an object/graph persistence framework.
It supports many features including
data validation, undo/redo, and lazy loading.
By default it stores data using SQLite.

Apps that use Core Data will not run in Preview mode.
The Simulator must be used instead.

One way to setup use of Core Data is to
check the "Use Core Data" checkbox on the options panel
when creating a new project.
This adds all the setup code and UI code for a simple app
that allows creating, deleting, and listing `Item` entities.
The app can be modified to work with other kinds of entities.

Another approach is to uncheck the "Use Core Data" checkbox
and set up use of Core Data manually.
The steps to do this are shown later.

### "Use Core Data" Option

When the "Use Core Data" checkbox is checked,
the generated files configure the use of Core Data.
The file `{app-name}App.swift` registers an "environment"
with the main `ContentView` that uses
a `PersistenceController` instance defined in `Persistence.swift`
and made available through a static `shared` property.
The main view defined in `ContentView.swift` has access to this
and uses the `@FetchRequest` property wrapper
to get `Item` objects from the persistent store.
The `Item` type is defined in `{app-name}.xcdatamodeld`
and has a single attribute `timestamp`.

The generated app is fully functional.
It displays a list of items that each have a timestamp.
Tap an item to get to a page that displays detail about just that item.
To delete an item, swipe it left and click the "Delete" button that appears.
To add an item with the current timestamp, click the "+" button at the top.
To delete items without swiping them, click the "Edit" button at the top.
This displays a red circle containing a minus sign to left of each item.
Click those to delete items.
When finished, click the "Done" button at the top
that replaced the "Edit" button.
From here you can edit the code to provide your own CRUD functionality.

### Defining Entities

To define Core Data entity types,
click the `{app-name}.xcdatamodeld` file in the Navigator pane.
This will display an entity editor.

If the "Use Core Data" option was checked,
consider deleting the provided `Item` entity
and any code that is specific to it.

Create a model file by right-clicking in the Navigator
and selecting "New File...".
For the template, scroll down to "Core Data" and select "Data Model".
For most projects only one of these files is needed
and the default name of "Model.xcdatamodeld" is fine.

Entities are similar to tables in a relational database.
Add entities to the model by clicking the "Add Entity" button at the bottom.
This will create an empty entity named "Entity".
Double-click the name and change it.
These become the names of generated class definitions,
so they should begin with an uppercase letter.
It is recommended to give them names that end in "Entity"
so it is clear in code that uses them that they are Core Data entities.
The generated classes inherit from `NSManagedObject`.

For each entity, click the "Module" drop-down inside
the Inspector on the right, select "Current Product Module".
TODO: Is this really desirable? What is the benefit?

Add attributes to each entity by
clicking the "+" at the bottom of the attribute list.
Each attribute is given a default name of "attribute".
Double-click the name and change it.
Some names, such as "description" and "for", are not allowed.
Select a type from a drop-down list of primitive types.
The type "Data" is for byte buffers.

Optionally sort the attributes.
They can be sorted on their name or type
by clicking on the "Attribute" or "Type" column heading.

By default each attribute is optional.
For any that are required, select the attribute and
uncheck the "Optional" checkbox in the inspector.

Optionally specify default values for each attribute.
Select an attribute and enter a value for "Default Value" in the inspector.

Optionally specify validation criteria for each attribute.
Select an attribute and enter values for "Validation" in the inspector.

Optionally add relationships between entities.
Each relationship specifies a
Relationship name, Destination, Type, and Delete Rule.
The "Type" in the Inspector can be "To One" or "To Many".

The "Delete Rule" in the Inspector can be "Nullify", "Cascade", or "Deny".

"Nullify" means instances can be deleted
without also deleting related entities.
References to deleted entities are set to `nil`.

"Cascade" means instances can be deleted
and related entities will also be deleted.

"Deny" means instances with related entities cannot be deleted.

Specify inverse relationships for most relationships.
For example, "PersonEntity" can have
an "owns" relationship "To Many" "DogEntity" and
"DogEntity" can have an "ownedBy" relationship "To One" "PersonEntity".

Optionally view the entities and their relationships as a graph.
To switch between viewing entities and their relationships
in "table" or "graph" style,
click the buttons in the lower-right labelled "Editor Style".
In graph view it may be necessary to toggle the relationships
in each entity by clicking the triangle to the left of "Relationships"
in order to see all of them.

If you see the error "cannot find type 'SomeEntityName' in scope",
close and reopen the project in Xcode.
In some cases, such as renaming entities,
it is necessary to clear existing data and start over.
To do this:

- clean the build folder by pressing cmd-shift-k
- quit out of Xcode
- cd to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
- run the `rm -rf` command on the directory for the project
- restart Xcode

### Entity Codegen

When an entity is selected in the Core Data model editor,
the Inspector displays its configuration options.
One of these is "Codegen" that has a default value of "Class Definition".
This means that Xcode will automatically generate a class definition
for the entity.
Typically this is the desired option.

By default, the source files for generated entity classes
do not appear in the Navigator.
However, they can be viewed by selecting
Product ... Show Build Folder in Finder.
The source files can be found in the ridiculously deep directory structure
Build/Intermediates.noindex/{app-name}.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/
{app-name}.build/DerivedSources/CoreDataGenerated/Model directory.

There are two generated files for each entity.
`{entity-name}+CoreDataClass.swift` defines the class
and should not be modified.
`{entity-name}+CoreDataProperties.swift` defines extensions to the class
and can be safely modified to add computed properties and methods.

Choosing a different value for the entity "Codegen" enables
generating entity sources files that appear in the Navigator.
The "Manual/None" option means that Xcode will not automatically generate
either of the files described above.
The "Category/Extension" option means that Xcode will
generate the `{entity-name}+CoreDataClass.swift` files,
but not the `{entity-name}+CoreDataProperties.swift` files.
TODO: Why does this also generate "Class" files?

To request generation of source files for entities whose
"Codegen" option is set to a value other than "Class Definition":

- Select Editor ... Create NSManagedObject Subclass...
- Select a model and click "Next". Most projects only have one model.
- Select the entities for which code should be generated and click "Next".
- Select the project subdirectory where the source files should be written.
  TODO: It seems this is ignored and the files are
  always written to the top project directory.
- Click "Create".

The generated "Class" files define a class for an entity
that inherits from `NSManagedObject`.
These file should not be modified.

The generated "Properties" files define extensions to the entity that
include a `fetchRequest` method.
This fetches all the instances of the entity,
properties that correspond to the entity attributes,
and methods for adding and removing other kinds of entities
that have a relationship to this one.
Theses file can be modified to add computed properties and methods.

### @FetchRequest vs. ViewModel

There are two popular ways for views to access data from Core Data.
One is to use `@FetchRequest`.
The other is to define a ViewModel class that views can use
which abstracts the use of Core Data away from them.

#### Using @FetchRequest

TODO: Add this based on code in your SwiftUI-GiftTrack project.

#### Using a ViewModel

Here are the steps to define and use a ViewModel
for accessing data in Core Data.

- Create a view model class.

  This can be defined in a file named "ViewModel.swift".
  It can define a class named "ViewModel" that inherits from `ObservableObject`
  which comes from the Combine framework.

- Declare a `container` constant property as follows:

  ```swift
  let container: NSPersistentContainer
  ```

- Declare a `context` variable property as follows:

  ```swift
  var context: NSManagedObjectContext { container.viewContext }
  ```

- Declare a published array property to hold
  all the instances of each entity type as follows:

  ```swift
  @Published var people: [PersonEntity] = []
  ```

- If Xcode doesn't recognize the entity types,
  close the project and reopen it.

- Define an initializer as follows:

  ```swift
  init() {
      // "Model" here must be the name of the "Data Model" file.
      container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "Model")

      container.loadPersistentStores { _, error in
          if let error = error {
              print("error loading Core Data:", error)
          } else {
              self.fetchPeople()
              // Possibly also fetch other kinds of entities here.
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- Define a method for each entity type that fetches all of its instances.
  The `List` view is useful for displaying them in a list.

  ```swift
  func fetchPeople() {
      // "PersonEntity" here must be the name of the entity type.
      let request = NSFetchRequest<PersonEntity>(entityName: "PersonEntity")
      // Optionally specify how the instances should be sorted.
      request.sortDescriptors = [
          NSSortDescriptor(key: "name", ascending: true)
      ]
      do {
          // people here must be the name of the
          // @Published property declared above.
          people = try context.fetch(request)
      } catch {
          print("fetchPeople error:", error.localizedDescription)
      }
  }
  ```

- Optionally add filtering to the `request` object above.

  TODO: Describe filter options here!

- Define a method to save changes to any data in the context.

  ```swift
  func saveContext() {
      do {
          try context.save()
      } catch {
          print("saveContext error:", error)
      }
  }
  ```

- Define a method for each entity type that the UI can call
  to add a new entity instance.

  ```swift
  func addPerson(name: String) {
      let person = PersonEntity(context: context)
      // Set all the attributes of the new entity instance.
      person.name = name
      saveContext()
      people.append(person)
      people.sort { ($0.name ?? "") < ($1.name ?? "") }
  }
  ```

- Define a method for each entity type that the UI can call
  to delete an entity instance.

  ```swift
  func deletePeople(indexSet: IndexSet) {
      for index in indexSet {
          context.delete(people[index])
          people.remove(at: index)
      }
      saveContext()
  }
  ```

- In each view that needs to access entity data,
  declare a property with the `@StateObject` property wrapper
  that has a type of `ViewModel`.
  Do not declare this to be `private` because
  it will be passed in from a parent view.

  ```swift
  @StateObject var vm: ViewModel
  ```

- To add an entity instance,
  call an "add" method defined in `ViewModel.swift`.

  ```swift
  vm.addPerson(name: name)
  ```

- To delete an entity instance,
  call a "delete" method defined in `ViewModel.swift`.
  Often this is done with the `onDelete` view modifier on a `ForEach`
  because that provides an `IndexSet` of selected indexes.

  ```swift
  .onDelete(perform: vm.deletePerson)
  ```

- To update an entity instance directly modify the attributes
  of an existing entity and then call the `saveContext` method

  ```swift
  person.name = "Some New Name"
  vm.savePeople()
  ```

### Entity Objects

Core Data entity objects have many properties and methods.

Each attribute is represented by a property
that can be directly accessed and modified.
Changes are not persisted unless `context.save()` is called.

Each relationship is represented by a property.

Properties for "To One" relationships have
an optional type matching the referenced entity type.
For example, `DogEntity` with an `ownedBy` relationship to a `PersonEntity`
has an `ownedBy` property with a type of `PersonEntity?`.
This can be directly set to a `PersonEntity` or `nil`.
For example, `someDog.ownedBy = somePerson` or `someDog.ownedBy = nil`.

Properties for "To Many" relationships have a type of optional `NSSet`.
For example, `PersonEntity` with an `owns` relationship to `DogEntity` instances
has an `owns` property whose type is `NSSet?`.
There are also `addToOwns` and `removeFromOwns` methods on the entity
that take a `DogEntity` and add to or remove from the `NSSet`.
For example, `somePerson.addToOwns(someDog)`
or `somePerson.removeFromOwns(someDog)`.

TODO: How can all instances of a given entity type be deleted?

### Fetching Entities

To fetch entities from an `NSManagedObjectContext`,
create an `NSFetchRequest` that identifies an entity type.
Optionally specify how the fetched entity instances should be sorted.
Also, optionally specify filtering to be applied
so that only a subset of the the entity instances will be fetched.

For details on the syntax used to specify filtering, see {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Predicates/Articles/pSyntax.html",
"Predicate Format String Syntax" %}.

```swift
let request = NSFetchRequest<PersonEntity>(entityName: "PersonEntity")

// Sort in ascending order on the "name" property.
request.sortDescriptors = [
    NSSortDescriptor(key: "name", ascending: true)
]

// Filter so only entities with a name beginning with "T" are fetched.
request.predicate = NSPredicate(format: "name beginswith %@", "T")

do {
    people = try context.fetch(request)
} catch {
    print("fetchPeople error:", error)
}
```

### Starting Over

The easiest way to delete the data an app has stored in Core Data
and start over with a clean slate
is to delete the app from the Simulator or a device
and reinstall it.

### CloudKit Integration

The contents of a Core Data database can be automatically synchronized
with a CloudKit database in iCloud.

When the database is "private" (the default), the data is
shared between all devices owned by a single user.
When the database is "public", the data is
shared between all users and all devices.
When the database is "shared", the data is
shared only with specific users.

For a working example, see this {% aTargetBlank
"https://github.com/mvolkmann/swiftui-cloudkit-core-data", "GitHub project" %}.

Both Core Data and CloudKit support storing structured data,
but they use different terminology.

| Topic   | Core Data              | CloudKit                       |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| objects | `NSManagedObject`      | `CKRecord`                     |
| models  | `NSManagedObjectModel` | `Schema`                       |
| stores  | `NSPersistentStore`    | `CKRecordZone` or `CKDatabase` |

Conversions between these types are performed automatically by
`NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`.
The file `Model.swift` in the example app,
creates a container of this type and ties it to the model
defined in the file `Model.xcdatamodeld`.

To combine the use of Core Data and CloudKit:

1. Create a new app and check the "Use Core Data"
   and "Host in CloudKit" checkboxes.
1. Add the "iCloud" capability.
1. Under "Services", check the "CloudKit" checkbox.
1. Under "Containers", click the "+" button and enter a container name
   that is "iCloud." plus your reverse internet domain
   followed by a period and the app name.
1. Add the "Background Modes" capability.
1. Check the "Remote notifications" checkbox.
1. Add source files similar to those in the example app linked above.

CloudKit prefixes all record and field names with "CD\_",
which is an abbreviation for "Core Data".
A system record named "Users" is created by default.
These records cannot be queried.

By default, a private database is created.
This is restricted to the current app user,
but is shared across all of their devices.

To enable querying records from the CloudKit Dashboard website:

1. Browse the CloudKit Dashboard at
   https://icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard/.
1. Click the big "CloudKit Database" button.
1. Select a CloudKit database from the dropdown at the top.
1. In the left nav under "Schema", click "Indexes".
1. For each record type, select it,
   click "Add Basic Index", select "recordName" from the dropdown,
   verify that an "Index Type" of "Queryable" is selected,
   click "Add Basic Index" again, select "modifiedTimestamp" from the dropdown,
   verify that an "Index Type" of "Queryable" is selected,
   and click the "Save Changes" button.
1. Under "Data" in the left nav, click "Records".
1. In the Database dropdown, select "Private Database".
1. In the Zone dropdown, select the zone created for you
   by `NSPersistentCloudKitDatabase` which is named
   "com.apple.coredata.cloudkit.zone", not "\_defaultZone".
1. In the "Record Type" dropdown, select a record name.
1. Click the "Query Records" button.
   Note that after adding records in the app it can take a minute
   until they appear in the CloudKit Dashboard.
1. To create a new record, click the "+" button after the "Records" heading,
   select a record type from the "Type" dropdown,
   select "Create New Record", enter a record name in the "CD_entityName" input,
   enter attribute values in the remaining inputs,
   and click the "Save" button.
   Relationship attribute values must be set to the unique id string
   of record to which they refer.
1. To modify record attributes, click a record name (blue link),
   edit data in the inspector panel on the right,
   click the "Save" button.
   To undo changes before saving them, click the "Reload" button.
1. To see changes in the record table, re-run the query.
1. To delete a record, click a record name (blue link),
   click the "Delete" button, and confirm by clicking another "Delete" button.

## StoreKit

{% aTargetBlank "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit",
"StoreKit" %} is an Apple framework that supports
in-app purchases, ad network attribution, Apple Music integration,
and enabling app ratings and reviews.

To use StoreKit in an app:

1. Create a new file.
1. Scroll the "Other" category.
1. Select "StoreKit Configuration File".
1. A file name can be entered, but the default name
   of "Configuration.storekit" is fine.
1. Click the "+" in the lower-left of the editor and select a type.
   For one-time purchases, select "Add Non-Consumable In-App Purchase".
1. Enter a "Reference Name". This can be the app name.
   To find this, click the top entry in the Navigator, select the "General" tab,
   and note the value of Identity ... Display Name.
1. Enter a "Product ID". This can be the project bundle identifier.
   To find this, click the top entry in the Navigator, select the "General" tab,
   and note the value of Identity ... Bundle Identifier.
1. Enter a price.
1. Under "Localizations", double-click an option such as "English (U.S.)".
1. Enter a "Display Name".
   This can be the same as the Reference Name entered above.
1. Enter a "Description" of the purchasable item.
1. Click "+" under "Localizations" to add more supported locales.
1. Repeat steps 5-12 for each additional non-consumable that can be purchased.
1. Create a new Swift file. A good name is `StoreKit.svelte`.
1. Add the following in `StoreKitStore.svelte`:

   ```swift
    import StoreKit

    class StoreKitStore: NSObject, ObservableObject {
        // This is a Set of purchasable product ids.
        private var allProductIdentifiers =
            Set(["r.mark.volkmann.gmail.com.GiftTrack"])

        private var productsRequest: SKProductsRequest?

        private var fetchedProducts: [SKProduct] = []

        typealias CompletionHandler = ([SKProduct]) -> Void

        private var completionHandler: CompletionHandler?

        override init() {
            super.init()
            fetchProducts { products in
                print("products =", products)
            }
        }

        private func fetchProducts(
            _ completion: @escaping CompletionHandler
        ) {
            guard productsRequest == nil else { return }
            completionHandler = completion
            productsRequest =
                SKProductsRequest(productIdentifiers: allProductIdentifiers)
            productsRequest?.delegate = self
            productsRequest?.start()
        }
    }

    extension StoreKitStore: SKProductsRequestDelegate {
        func productsRequest(
            _ request: SKProductsRequest,
            didReceive response: SKProductsResponse
        ) {
            let loadedProducts = response.products
            let invalidProducts = response.invalidProductIdentifiers
            guard !loadedProducts.isEmpty else {
                print("failed to load products")
                if !invalidProducts.isEmpty {
                    print("invalid products found: \(invalidProducts)")
                }
                productsRequest = nil
                return
            }

            // Cache the fetched products.
            fetchedProducts = loadedProducts

            // Notify listeners of loaded products.
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.completionHandler?(loadedProducts)
                self.completionHandler = nil
                self.productsRequest = nil
            }
        }
    }
   ```

1. In the `{app-name}.swift` file, add the following
   inside the struct that inherits from `App`:

   ```swift
   @StateObject private var store = StoreKitStore()
   ```

1. In any views that need to access the store, add the following:

   ```swift
   @EnvironmentObject private var store: StoreKitStore
   ```

1. In the Navigator, select `{app-name}.swift`.
1. In the top bar, click the project name to the left of the device drop-down
   and select "Edit Scheme..." which opens a dialog.
1. Click "Run" in the dialog left nav.
1. Click the "Options" tab.
1. Change the value of "StoreKit Configuration"
   from "None" to "Configuration.storekit".
1. Click the "Close" button.

## UIKit Integration

The UIKit framework preceded the SwiftUI framework.
While SwiftUI is the future, it is still missing some features of UIKit.

It is possible to embed the use of UIKit in a SwiftUI app.
The key to doing this is to wrap UIKit views in a `UIRepresentable` wrapper.

Here is an example of wrapping the use of `UITextField`
so it can be used in the SwiftUI app.
One feature this has that is missing from the SwiftUI `TextField` view
is the ability to include a clear button on the trailing end
that is an "X" in a circle. Tapping this clears the value.

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct MyUITextField: UIViewRepresentable {
    var placeholder = ""
    @Binding var text: String

    func makeCoordinator() -> Coordinator {
        Coordinator(text: $text)
    }

    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> UITextField {
        let textField = UITextField()

        textField.borderStyle = .roundedRect
        textField.clearButtonMode = .whileEditing
        textField.delegate = context.coordinator
        textField.placeholder = placeholder

        return textField
    }

    func updateUIView(_ uiView: UITextField, context: Context) {
        uiView.text = text
    }

    class Coordinator: NSObject, UITextFieldDelegate {
        @Binding var text: String

        init(text: Binding<String>) {
            self._text = text
        }

        func textFieldDidChangeSelection(_ textField: UITextField) {
            print("in textFieldDidChangeSelection")
            text = textField.text ?? ""
        }
    }
}
```

To use this inside a SwiftUI view, add code like the following:

```swift
@State private var firstName = "Mark"
...
MyUITextField(placeholder: "First Name", text: $firstName)
    .frame(height: 31)
```

## App Demos

One approach for demonstrating iOS apps to others
using a real device instead of the Simulator is to use QuickTime.
The steps to do this are:

1. Enable "Developer Mode" on an iPhone
   (Settings ... Privacy & Security ... Developer Mode).
1. Attach an iPhone to a computer running macOS using a USB cable.
1. Launch the QuickTime Player application.
1. Select File ... New Movie Recording.
1. Click the drop-down next to the record button and select "iPhone".
1. Connect with another user using a video chat service
   that supports screen sharing such as Google Meet.
1. Share your screen.
1. Demonstrate apps on the iPhone.
1. When finished, quit QuickTime Player without saving the recorded movie
   and eject the iPhone from Finder.

## App Clips

From the Apple {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/",
"App Clips documentation" %}
"An App Clip is a lightweight version of your app that
offers users access to some of the app’s functionality."

App Clips binaries must be small.
For iOS 15 and before the limit is 10 MB.
For iOS 16 and beyond the limit is 15 MB.

To implement an app clip for an existing app,
create a new target from the "App Clip" template.
Select source files in the main app that should be shared with the
App Clip by checking the appropriate checkboxes in the Inspector.

App Clips differ from widgets in that they can be interactive
whereas widgets cannot.

## Questions

- How can I change the default device used by new projects?
  It defaults to "iPod touch (7th generation)".

- With over 4000 icons in SF Symbols,
  how can there be none related to animals?
  Perhaps Apple feels that emojis should be used for these.

- Adoption of Swift and SwiftUI would be much higher if
  there was a way to generate an Android app from a Swift app.

- Why do SwiftUI `ViewBuilders` support `if` and `switch` statements,
  but not `for` loops? We have to use the `ForEach` view instead.

- Why doesn't SwiftUI provide a way to specify default styling
  that applies to all views in an app,
  similar to CSS for web applications?

- Why do `Picker` views appear to be disabled
  unless they are wrapped in a `NavigationView` and a `Form`?
