## Overview

iOS 16 introduced the {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/photospicker",
"PhotosPicker" %} view.

It provides an easier way to allow users to
select assets from their photo library than using {% aTargetBlank
"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiimagepickercontroller",
"UIPickerController" %} from UIKit.

See the excellent YouTube videos from Stewart Lynch, {% aTargetBlank
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfUBKhZLcK0", "PhotosPicker - SwiftUI" %}.

## Example App

See {% aTargetBlank "https://github.com/mvolkmann/PhotosPickerDemo",
"PhotosPickerDemo" %} which demonstrates everything
shared in the Steward Lynch video linked above.

The app has two tabs.

<img alt="PhotosPicker Initial" style="border: 1px solid gray; width: 50%"

### Single Image tab

The first tab "Single Image" allows the user
to select a single image from their photo library.
Tap the icon in the upper-right corner to view the photo library.

### Multiple Images tab

to select multiple images from their photo library.
Tap the icon in the upper-right corner to view the photo library.
