### Overview

Apple Reminders is an excellent app for task management.
It runs on Mac computers (macOS), iPads (iPadOS),
iPhones (iOS), and Apple Watches (watchOS).
The data is synced across all these devices.

Reminders can be added using Siri.
Just speak phrases in forms like the following:

- Remind me to {task}
- Add a reminder to my {list-name} list to {task}
- Remind me to {task} at {time} today
- Remind me to {task} at {time} on {day-or-date}
- Remind me to {task} on {date} at {time}
- Remind me to {task} when I get home
- Remind me to {task} when I get to work

By default, reminders are added to your default list.
This is specified in Settings for the Reminders app
and defaults to "Inbox".

The instructions below are primarily focused on
using Reminders in iPadOS.
The same functionality is available on macOS and iOS,
but may be organized slightly differently.

In iPadOS and macOS, the Reminders app displays a left nav area and a main area.
The left nav area displays large buttons for navigating to "pinned lists",
followed by the names of non-pinned lists.
Tapping a list button or name opens the list in the main area.

### Unorganized Content

- Reminders app: The kanban board columns are really sections that can be created in another way when not in list view (view as columns versus view as list; manage columns versus manage sections)
- Describe creating an adding tags to items. This can be done either from the button or from the get info dialogue.
- tap the eye button for a reminder item to get the option to add subtasks
- select “show list info” to get a dialogue where you can change the color and icon for a list
- describe creating smart lists that are based on a set of tags; there is a button at the bottom of the show info. Dialogue to convert a normal list to a smart list.
- “View as Columns” adds the ability to drag items to different columns, which are actually sections
- Reminders can link to Mail, Notes, Safari, and Messages items (It’s easy to create a reminder from an item in those apps instead of adding the link inside the Reminders app? In other apps, do this through the share button. Tap the Reminders app. That opens a dialogue where remind your text can be entered. In macOS, you can drag items directly into the Reminders app. You can also do this in iOS, if you tap and hold an item, then swipe up from the bottom of the screen to select the Reminders app then drop the item onto a target list.)
- you can receive reminder notifications based on your location. To do this, select a reminder, tap the info button, turn on location, and select a location, such as home or work. It will be marked as showing the reminder either when you arrive or when you leave the location. To toggle that, tap the location again.
- You can add a date to each reminder. That can be the date the item should be completed or the date on which you should be reminded. You can also select a specific time on that day. Reminders with a date can be set to repeat at a specified interval.
- There are several widgets you can add to your home screen for the Reminders app.
- Tapping the hollow circle on the left side of a reminder marks it as completed, but doesn’t delete it. You can still choose to view the completed items.
- Lists of type “Groceries” automatically categorize their items in categories like Beverages, Dairy, and Produce.
- Tap the three dots in the upper-right and then “Show Completed” to see items marked as completed (or purchased). Tap specific completed items to return them to the uncompleted state. This is great for updating a grocery list.
- Dictating new reminders is faster than typing them.
- To add a reminder with Siri, say “add **_ to my _** list”.
- When changing the icon for a list, tap the emoji icon to select any emoji (more detailed and multi-color)
- Can add arbitrary tags to a reminder or to all selected reminders.
- click a tag in the left nav to see all the reminders that have that tag.
- Describe how to rename and delete tags.
- Smart lists show all reminders with specified tags or priority. Their icon has a small gear in the lower right corner. They can be set to match on any or all conditions.
- A normal list can be converted to a smart list.
- Does every reminder need to reside in some non-smart list?
- A reminder can have subtasks, created by dragging a reminder into the parent.
- Subtasks are indented.
- Subtasks can be collapsed and the parent will display the number of hidden subtasks.
- Marking all subtasks as completed does not mark the parent task as completed.
- To drag a reminder and not have the app think you want to modify its description, drag from the right of the description.
- Can share a list with other Apple users so multiple people can view and update it.
- Can assign tasks to specific people that are sharing a list.
- Can create a list template from an existing list.
- Can create a new list from a template. This is ideal for packing lists. Create the template once and create a new list from it for every trip. After the trip, delete the list, but keep the template for future trips.
- To create a template from an existing list, select a list, tap … in the upper right, and select “Save as Template”.
- To create a new list from a template, tap “Add List”, tap the “Templates” tab, tap a template, enter a name for the new list, and tap “Create”.
- To edit an existing template, tap ... at the top of the left column, select “Templates”, tap “i” to the right of a template name, tap “Edit Template”, makes changes, and tap “Done”. This will not modify existing lists that were created from the template.
- Lists can be grouped into a groups (folders) like your Computer list.
- Do you create a group by dragging one list on top of another? You can also create a group by tapping … at the top of the left nav, tapping “Edit Lists” in the popup, and tapping “New Group” at the bottom of the left nav.
- When you select a group in the left NAV, all the list inside it will appear in the main area grouped in sections that are the list names.
- The Today list can group its items by morning, afternoon, and evening. They seem to be automatically assigned at times of 9 AM, 3 PM, and 6 PM.
- In the info dialogue for a task you can add early reminders to be reminded before the due date.
- Lists can be sorted on many criteria and then ascending or descending order.
- New reminders are added to the currently selected list.
- Each reminder can optionally include notes, URL, date, time, early reminders (alerts), repeat interval, tags, location, flag, priority, images
- When a reminder is selected, the buttons at the top allow adding a date, time, location. flag, and tags.
- The default list for new reminders added with Siri is specified in the Settings for the Reminders app.
- The time at which you will be reminded about reminders that have a date, but no time, is specified in the Settings for the Reminders app.
- Including the number of reminders due today as a badge on the Reminders app icon is enabled in the Settings for the Reminders app. This seems to appear on the icon regardless of this setting.
- Can add three different widget sizes to home screen to enable viewing reminders and marking them as completed without going to the app.
