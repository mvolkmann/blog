## Overview

GiftTrack is an iOS application for keeping track of
gift ideas and purchased gifts for
multiple people and multiple occasions throughout the year.
Download it from the iOS App Store.

To use the app:

1. Tap "People" and add people.
2. Tap "Occasions" and add occasions.
3. Tap "Gifts" and add gifts for specific people and occasions.

The app is free but is limited to
tracking gifts for two people and two occasions.
If you attempt to add more people or occasions,
you will be prompted to make an in-app purchase which
enables tracking gifts for an unlimited number of people and occasions.

## Deleting Data

To delete a person, occasion, or gift, swipe left
to reveal a "Delete" button and tap it.

## Moving and Copying Gifts

To move or copy a gift to a different person and/or occasion,
tap the gift, tap the "Move" or "Copy" button,
select the target person and occasion,
and tap the "Move" or "Copy" button again.

## Customizing Colors and Start Screen

To change the background and title colors, tap "Settings",
tap one of the color circles, and select a new color.
If the contrast between the background and title colors is too low,
a message will be displayed asking you to select different colors.

If the colors are not customized, switching the phone between
light and dark mode in the Settings app changes the colors used in the app.
But if the colors have been customized on the app Settings screen,
the app will use the selected colors regardless of whether
the phone is in light or dark mode.

When the app is launched, the "About" tab is selected by default.
To change the screen that is selected initially,
tap "Settings" and select a different value for "Start Screen".
The "Gifts" screen is recommended since it is the screen
with which you will interact most frequently.

To reset the colors back to the defaults
and reset the start screen to its default values,
tap "Settings" and tap the "Reset" button.

## Gift Details

The amount of detail that can be entered for each gift is up to you.
