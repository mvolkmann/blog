My favorite movie from 2024 is "Here".
It stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright as Richard and Margaret,
both of whom also appeared in the movie "Forest Gump".

The entire movie takes place from the viewpoint of
a single camera position and direction.
It depicts a single location that is likely in Pennsylvania.
Many of the scenes take place in the living room of a home built at the site,
but many also take place at the site before the home was built.

The movie frequently jumps back and forth in time.
Often while watching you will wonder if the movie has a point.
The point is that many events take place in any given location
over a long span of time.
The living room hosts many important moments in the lives of
the many people that owned the house at different times.

The movie superimposes facial clips from earlier movies in which
the actors appeared (like "Big") to make the characters look younger.

A consistent theme in the movie is regret expressed by many of the characters
about ambitions not pursued in order to provide for their family.

You really need to watch this movie twice to catch all the details.

At several points in her marriage to Richard, Margaret expresses a
strong desire to move out of the family house and buy their own place.
Richard never agrees because he fears going into debt
and is constantly worried about taxes.
This becomes a primary reason for their eventual divorce.

In the end, the movie causes you to reflect on all the events
and phases in your own life and to value your remaining years.

For those interested in more detail, some of the points in time
depicted in the movie include those when:
