## Overview

{% aTargetBlank "https://www.rust-lang.org/", "Rust" %} is a
programming language for building reliable and efficient software.

Features of Rust include:

- fast
- memory-efficient
- rich type system
- ownership model to guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety

## Installing

Rust is installed using the {% aTargetBlank "", "rustup" %} tool.

To install rustup in macOS, install {% aTargetBlank "", "homebrew" %}
and then enter `brew install rustup`.

To install rustup in Linux (or macOS), enter the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

To install rustup in Windows,
use {% aTargetBlank "https://chocolatey.org/", "Chocolately" %}
or {% aTargetBlank "https://scoop.sh/", "Scoop" %}.

After installing rustup, enter `rustup-init`.
This configures the use of Rust in the bash and zsh shells.
When using the fish shell, add the following in `.config/fish/config.fish`:

```bash
set -x PATH $PATH $HOME/.cargo/bin
```

Verify installation by entering `rustc --version`.

## Hello World

The following is a Rust Hello World program:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

## Compiling Code

To compile a `.rs` file, enter `rustc {name}.rs`.
This creates an executable with the same name and no file extension.
For example `rustc hello.rs` creates `hello`.
To run the executable, enter `./` followed by the name.
For example, `./hello`.

## Formatting Code

The most popular code formatting tool for Rust is
{% aTargetBlank "", "rustfmt" %}.
To install this, enter `cargo install rustfmt`.
TODO: Is this installed by default by rustup?

To run it on all `.rs` files in the current directory,
enter `rustfmt *.rs`.

## <a name="webassembly">WebAssembly</a>

Tools for compiling Rust code to WebAssembly include
{% aTargetBlank "https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/", "wasm-pack" %} and
{% aTargetBlank "https://www.secondstate.io/articles/ssvmup/", "ssvmup" %}
The last update to wasm-pack was on February 7, 2020,
so this project may be abandoned.
The ssvmup tool was inspired by wasm-pack and has explicit support for Deno.

To compile a `.rs` file to WebAssembly:

1. Install ssvmup by entering the following command (one time only):

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/second-state/ssvmup/master/installer/init.sh -sSf | sh
   ```

1. Create a new Rust library (referred to as a "crate")
   by entering `cargo new --lib my-crate`

1. `cd my-crate`

1. Edit `src/lib.rs` and add code there.
   For example:

   ```rust
   use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

   #[wasm_bindgen]
   pub fn factorial(x: u64) -> u64 {
       match x {
           0 | 1 => 1,
           _ => x * factorial(x - 1),
       }
   }
   ```

1. Edit the generated `Cargo.toml` file
   which is similar to a Node.js `package.json` file.
   For example:

   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "my-crate"
   version = "0.1.0"
   authors = ["R. Mark Volkmann <me@gmail.com>"]
   edition = "2018"
   description = "sample project using ssvmup"
   license = "MIT/Apache-2.0"
   #repository = "https://github.com/mvolkmann/my-crate"

   [lib]
   crate-type = ["cdylib"]

   [dependencies]
   wasm-bindgen = "=0.2.61"
   ```

1. Enter `ssvmup build --target deno`  
   This creates a `pkg` directory containing
   `package.json`, a `.wasm` file, and a `.js` file that
   reads the `.wasm` file and prepares it for use in JavaScript code.

1. Copy the generated `pkg` directory to the directory
   containing the Deno code that wishes to use it.

1. Import the exported functions with a line like the following:

   ```js
   import {factorial} from './pkg/my_crate.js';
   ```

1. Call the imported functions.

   ```js
   console.log(factorial(4n));
   ```
