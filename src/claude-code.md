## Overview

{% aTargetBlank
"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview",
"Claude Code" %} is "an agentic coding tool made by Anthropic.
Currently in beta as a research preview."

The cost is based on usage, not on a flat monthly fee.
Reports so far claim it is quite expensive,
perhaps four times the cost of using Cursor.
