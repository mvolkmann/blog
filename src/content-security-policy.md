## Overview

A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"
target="_blank">Content Security Policy</a> provides
the ability to detect and prevent some types of attacks,
including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
It can also report attempted attacks.

A CSP can be enabled with an HTTP response header or with an HTML `meta` tag.
It both cases, the policy is specified by a list of
directives separated by semicolons.

Each directive is specified with a name and one or more values,
all separated by a space.
The values are CSP-specific keywords (such as `self`)
and/or allowed URL patterns.

The following `meta` tag provides an example.
It specifies that by default all resource types
can only be downloaded from the current origin.
An exception is made for images which can
come from any origin as long as HTTPS is used.
No scripts are allowed to be loaded, even those from the current origin.

```html
<meta
  http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; script-src 'none';"
/>
```

Using a CSP reduces, but does not eliminate
the need to sanitize user-entered HTML.

## Directives

Commonly used directives include:

- `default-src`: restricts access to all kinds of resources
- `connect-src`: restricts use of <a>, fetch, XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket, and more
- `font-src`: restricts @font-face CSS at-rule
- `form-action`: restricts URLs used in `form` element `action` attributes
- `img-src`: restricts `<img>` elements
- `media-src`: restricts `<audio>` and `<video>` elements
- `object-src`: restricts `<object>` and `<embed>` elements
- `report-uri`: specifies the URL where violation reports are sent
- `script-src-attr`: restricts sources for JavaScript inline event handlers like `onclick`
- `script-src-elem`: restricts `<script>` elements
- `script-src`: combines the previous two in one directive
- `worker-src`: restricts Worker, SharedWorker, and ServiceWorker scripts

It is recommended to make `default-src` very restrictive (often just `'self'`)
and used more specific directives to
open access for specific kinds of resources.

A small set of directives that are not commonly used
can only be specified in HTTP headers and not in `meta` tags.

See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"
target="_blank">Content Security Policy</a>
for a table of CSP directives that are supported by each browser.

## Keywords

CSP Keywords are surrounded by single quotes
to distinguish them from URL patterns.

The keywords that can be used in directive values include:

- `inline-speculation-rules`

  This allows inclusion of "speculation rules" which are experimental.

- `nonce-*`

  This is a whitelist of inline scripts, indentified by
  a cryptographic nonce value, that are allowed.

- `none`

  This prevents loading any resources.

- `report-sample`

  This causes a sample of the violating code
  to be included in violation reports.
  It is used in `script-src` and `script-src-elem` directives.

- `self`

  This only allows loading resources from the current origin.
  It is the most commonly used keyword.

- `sha{algorithm}-{value}`

  This is used in `script-src` and `styles-src` directives
  to allow resources with a matching hash value.

- `strict-dynamic`

  This allows dynamically generated JavaScript code to be executed
  only if it is generated by a script that is
  whitelisted using the `nonce-*` keyword.

- `unsafe-eval`

  This enables use of the JavaScript `eval` function,
  the `Function` constructor, and passing strings of JavaScript code
  to the `setTimeout` and `setInterval` functions.

- `unsafe-inline`

  This enables evaluating inline `script` elements,
  `javascript:` URLs, inline event handlers, and inline `style` elements.

- `unsafe-hashes`

  This enables evaluating inline event handling functions,
  which is a subset of what `unsafe-inline` enables.

- `wasm-unsafe-eval`

  This enables loading and executing WebAssembly modules.

## Example CSP Headers

- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' demo.com *.demo.com`

  This specifies that by default all resources must come from
  the same domain ss this request OR
  from `demo.com` or any domain that ends in `demo.com`.

- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *; media-src my-media.org; script-src https://coder.io`

  This specifies that images can come from anywhere,
  audio and video can come from `my-media.org`,
  scripts can come from `coder.io` only using HTTPS,
  and all other resources must come from the same domain as this request.
  `default-src` specifies the policy for all resource types
  unless policies for specific resource types are also provided.

## Reporting

To report attempts to violate the CSP but not prevent them,
use the `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header.
This may be useful during development to determine the
CSP directives that are desired before going to production.

Violation attempts are reported by
sending a JSON object in an HTTP POST request.
To specify where reports will be sent
add the `report-uri` directive with a value that
is the URL where POST requests will be sent.
This can be added to the value of the
`Content-Security-Policy` or `Content-Security-Policy-Report` header.
There is no need to supply both headers.

The `report-uri` directive must be specified in an HTTP response header,
not in a `meta` tag.

The `report-uri` directive will be replaced by `report-to` in the future.

A report JSON object contains many properties including:

- `blocked-uri`

  This gives the URI that violated a policy.

- `disposition`

  This will be
  "enforce" if triggered by a `Content-Security-Policy` header or
  "report" if triggered by a `Content-Security-Report-Policy` header.

- `document-uri`

  This gives the URI of the document that requested the resource.

- `effective-directive`

  This gives the directive that was violated.

- `script-sample`

  This gives the first 40 characters of the violating script or CSS.

The following is an example report that describes
an issue with getting an image from Unsplash.
Note the properties "effective-directive" and "blocked-uri".

```json
{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "http://localhost:3000/",
    "referrer": "http://localhost:3000/",
    "violated-directive": "img-src",
    "effective-directive": "img-src",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ws:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com; media-src 'self' http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com; script-src-elem 'self' https://unpkg.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; report-uri /csp-report",
    "disposition": "report",
    "blocked-uri": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1629985692757-48648f4f1fc1",
    "line-number": 55,
    "source-file": "http://localhost:3000/",
    "status-code": 200,
    "script-sample": ""
  }
}
```

A great way to arrive at the desired CSP to start with only the following:

```ts
const policies = [
  // This specifies where POST requests for violation reports will be sent.
  'report-uri /csp-report',

  // Only resources from the current domain are allowed
  // unless overridden by a more specific directive.
  "default-src 'self'"
];
const csp = policies.join('; ');
```

It the server code that configures serving static files
from a directory like "public", add the
"Content-Security-Policy" header with the value in the `csp` variable.

With Hono this can be done as follows:

```typescript
app.use('/*', (c: Context, next: Next) => {
  c.header('Content-Security-Policy', csp);
  const yearSeconds = 31536000;
  c.header(
    'Strict-Transport-Security',
    `max-age=${yearSeconds}; includeSubDomains`
  );
  const fn = serveStatic({root: './public'});
  return fn(c, next);
});
```

Now define an endpoint to receive the violation reports.
With Hono this can be done as follows:

```typescript
app.post('/csp-report', async (c: Context) => {
  const json = await c.req.json();
  const report = json['csp-report'];
  let file = report['document-uri'];
  if (file.endsWith('/')) file = 'index.html';
  console.log(
    `${file} attempted to access ${report['blocked-uri']} which ` +
      `violates the ${report['effective-directive']} CSP directive.`
  );
  c.status(403);
  return c.text('CSP violation');
});
```

Start the server, browse the app, and exercise all of its functionality.
Output in the terminal where the server is running will describe
all the CSP violations.
One-by-one add the desired CSP directives in the `policies` array
until all the desired policies are in place.

## Example Web App

The following code implements an HTTP server using the JavaScript-based
server <a href="https://hono.dev" target="_blank">Hono</a> library.
It also uses <a href="/blog/topics/#/blog/htmx/" target="_blank">htmx</a>.

```typescript
import {type Context, Hono, type Next} from 'hono';
import {serveStatic} from 'hono/bun';
import './reload-server.js';

const policies = [
  // This specifies where POST requests for violation reports will be sent.
  // In the future, "report-uri" will be replaced by "report-to".
  'report-uri /csp-report',

  // Only resources from the current domain are allowed
  // unless overridden by a more specific directive.
  "default-src 'self'",

  // This allows sending HTTP requests to the JSONPlaceholder API.
  // It also allows reload-client.js to create a WebSocket.
  "connect-src 'self' https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com ws:",

  // This allows getting Google fonts.
  // "link" tags for Google fonts have an href
  // that begins with https://fonts.googleapis.com.
  // The linked font file contains @font-face CSS rules
  // with a src URL beginning with https://fonts.gstatic.com.
  'font-src https://fonts.googleapis.com https://fonts.gstatic.com',

  // This allows getting images from Unsplash.
  'img-src https://images.unsplash.com',

  // This allows getting videos from googleapis.
  'media-src http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com',

  // This allows downloading the htmx library from a CDN.
  "script-src-elem 'self' 'report-sample' https://unpkg.com",

  // This allows htmx.min.js to insert style elements.
  "style-src-elem 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com"
];
const csp = policies.join('; ');
// console.log('server.tsx: csp =', csp);

const app = new Hono();

// Serve static files from the public directory.
// app.use('/*', serveStatic({root: './public'}));
app.use('/*', (c: Context, next: Next) => {
  c.header('Content-Security-Policy', csp);

  // Tell the browser that the site can only be accessed using HTTPS,
  // and that future attempts to access it using HTTP
  // should be automatically converted to HTTPS.
  const yearSeconds = 31536000;
  c.header(
    'Strict-Transport-Security',
    `max-age=${yearSeconds}; includeSubDomains`
  );

  const fn = serveStatic({root: './public'});
  return fn(c, next);
});

app.get('/dom-xss', (c: Context) => {
  return c.text("alert('A DOM XSS occurred!')");
});

app.get('/reflective-xss', (c: Context) => {
  return c.html("<script>alert('A reflective XSS occurred!');</script>");
});

app.get('/version', (c: Context) => {
  // Return a Response whose body contains
  // the version of Bun running on the server.
  return c.text('v' + Bun.version);
});

// This receives reports of CSP violations in a JSON object.
app.post('/csp-report', async (c: Context) => {
  const json = await c.req.json();
  const report = json['csp-report'];
  // console.log(report);
  let file = report['document-uri'];
  if (file.endsWith('/')) file = 'index.html';
  console.log(
    `${file} attempted to access ${report['blocked-uri']} which ` +
      `violates the ${report['effective-directive']} CSP directive.`
  );
  c.status(403);
  return c.text('CSP violation');
});

export default app;
```

The following HTML in `public/index.html` relies on
the CSP defined in the server to access several resources.

```

## integrity Attribute in script tags

To prevent executing a script whose contents have been altered,
perhaps maliciously, include an `integrity` attribute in the `script` tag.
The value is a hash that is computed based on the contents of the script.
This is referred to as "SubResource Integrity" (SRI).

Using SRI is especially important when scripts are obtained from a CDN.
SRI is not typically enforced for scripts loaded from the same origin.

The `integrity` value must begin with a string that identifies
the hash algorithm, followed by a dash and the hash.
For an example, see the `script` tag for htmx in the HTML shown
in the previous section.

One way to generate a hash for a trusted, online resource is to use the site
<a href="https://www.srihash.org" target="_blank">SRI Hash Generator</a>.

One way to generate a hash for a trusted, local file
is the use the `openssl` command. For example:

```bash
cat public/my-script.js | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A
```

## Cross-Site Scripting Attacks (XSS)

There are three types of XSS attacks.

### Reflected XSS

In this form of XSS, an HTTP endpoint returns
a string containing one or more `script` tags.
Client-side JavaScript then sets the `innerHTML` of some element
to the string.
That causes the `script` tags to be executed.

A CSP can prevent such scripts from being executed.
The easiest way is to include the directive `default-src 'self'`.
To intentionally allow executing such scripts, include `'unsafe-inline'`
in the value of the `script-src` or `script-src-elem` directive.

For an example of an endpoint that returns a `script` tag,
see the GET endpoint for `/reflective-xss` above.

### Stored XSS

In this form of XSS, user-entered content is stored, perhaps in a database.
The content is later used in generated web pages.

This can be dangerous if users enter `script` tags and the content
is later added as `innerHTML` because the scripts will be executed.
On the other hand, adding the content as `textContent`
will display `script` tags, but not execute them.

### DOM XSS

In this form of XSS, JavaScript running in a browser gets a string
from a source such as the page URL or a fetch request, and executes it.
One way to execute the string as JavaScript code
is to pass it to the `eval` function.
Another way is to set the `innerHTML` of a DOM element to the string.

With a strict default CSP in place, calling the `fetch` function
from an inline script (such as a `script` tag that contains JavaScript code)
is only allowed if the `script-src` or `script-src-elem` directive
includes `'unsafe-inline'`.
In addition, calling the `eval` function is only allowed
if the `script-src` directive includes `'unsafe-eval'`.

For an example of an endpoint that returns a string of JavaScript code,
see the GET endpoint for `/dom-xss` above.

The following HTML uses the `fetch` function
to send a GET request to that endpoint.
It then passes the string of JavaScript that is returned
oto the `eval` function.

```html
<script>
  async function domXSS() {
    const res = await fetch('/dom-xss');
    const text = await res.text();
    eval(text);
  }
  window.onload = domXSS;
</script>
```
