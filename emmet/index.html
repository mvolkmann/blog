It also supports many &quot;actions&quot; that operate on HTML and XML elements. The most commonly used action is to expand an abbreviation or snippet.</p><p>Emmet was created by Sergey Chikuyonok. The original name was &quot;Zen Coding.&quot;</p><p>Emmet is available for many editors including Atom, Eclipse, Emacs, Notepad++, Sublime, Vim, Visual Studio (VS) Code, and WebStorm. However, some implementations do not support all the defined snippets and actions.</p><p>Emmet is not just a simple snippet manager. It parses entered text to extract meaning. These kinds of snippets are referred to as &quot;dynamic snippets.&quot;</p><p>See my Object Computing (OCI) article <a href="https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/march-2018-emmet-editor-plugin?v=1.0.14" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Emmet Editor Plugin for Dynamic HTML/CSS Snippets</a>.</p></article>
