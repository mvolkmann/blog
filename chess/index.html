I am not a highly rated chess player, so these are just guidelines that beginner to intermediate players might find useful.</p><ol><li>Attempt to control the center of the board.</li><li>Look for potential attacks from opponent.</li><li>Count the number of pieces attacking and defending each square and consider the values of the pieces that would be exchanged.</li><li>When planning the next move, verify that it isn't weakening the defense of your pieces.</li><li>Avoid blocking your own pieces, especially behind pawns.</li><li>Avoid pawn attacks that result to multiple pawns in the same file.</li><li>Avoid placing knights on the edge of the board because that leaves them with fewer target squares.</li><li>Having two bishops and no knights is typically slightly better (half point?) than having only two knights or having only one bishop and one knight.</li><li>Plan and defend against forks.</li><li>Plan and defend against skewers.</li><li>Plan and defend against discovered attacks.</li><li>Avoid moving the same piece twice because it loses a tempo (turn).</li><li>Usually avoid moving backwards.</li><li>Try to be more aggressive (attacking or forcing a response) than passive (defending).</li><li>Don't swap pieces if no advantage is gained, i.e. don't trade a piece with a good position for a piece with a lesser position.</li><li>Utilized the king in the end game, especially to protect pawns.</li><li>Utilize &quot;head on a stick&quot; moves where a piece is defended by a pawn that is one rank behind it.</li></ol></article>
