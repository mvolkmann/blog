Of course your opponent will likely not allow you to move to these positions but it is a good goal.</p><p><img alt="controlling center" style="width: 60%" src="/blog/assets/chess-controlling-center.png?v=1.0.20" title="controlling center"></p></li><li><p>Look for potential attacks from opponent, especially ones that put you in check AND threaten other pieces.</p></li><li><p>Count the number of pieces attacking and defending each square and consider the values of the pieces that would be exchanged.</p></li><li><p>When planning the next move, verify that it isn't weakening the defense of your pieces.</p></li><li><p>Avoid blocking your own pieces, especially behind pawns.</p></li><li><p>Avoid pawn attacks that result to multiple pawns in the same file.</p></li><li><p>Avoid placing knights on the edge of the board because that leaves them with fewer target squares.</p></li><li><p>Having two bishops and no knights is typically slightly better (half point?) than having only two knights or having only one bishop and one knight.</p></li><li><p>Plan and defend against forks.</p></li><li><p>Plan and defend against skewers.</p></li><li><p>Plan and defend against discovered attacks.</p></li><li><p>Avoid moving the same piece twice because it loses a tempo (turn).</p></li><li><p>Usually avoid moving backwards.</p></li><li><p>Try to be more aggressive (attacking or forcing a response) than passive (defending).</p></li><li><p>Don't swap pieces if no advantage is gained, i.e. don't trade a piece with a good position for a piece with a lesser position.</p></li><li><p>Utilized the king in the end game, especially to protect pawns.</p></li><li><p>Utilize &quot;head on a stick&quot; moves where a piece is defended by a pawn that is one rank behind it.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes it is good to take a piece that is protected because if they take back they expose a more valuable piece.</p></li></ol><h2 id="notation" tabindex="-1">Notation</h2><p>King = K Knight = N Queen = 0 Rook = R Bishop = B Pawn = just square moved to Capture = X Check = + Checkmate = # Castle Kingside = 0-0 Castle Queenside = 0.0.0</p></article>
