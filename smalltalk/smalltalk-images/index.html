Everything in Smalltalk is represented by an object, including class definitions (yours and those provided), GUI elements in the development environment, and objects created from Workspaces.</p><p>An image can be used to manage collections of data, perhaps held in <code>Dictionary</code> objects, as an alternative to using a database.</p><p>One way to start an image is to double-click its file.</p><p>To save any changes, open the World menu and select &quot;Save Image&quot;, &quot;Save Image as&quot;, or &quot;Save Image and Quit&quot;. The changes include all placed morphs (includes development enviroment windows), their position, size, and colors, selections made (ex. System Browser top pane selections), and window content (ex. Workspaces).</p><p>To quit without saving changes, open the World menu and select &quot;Quit without saving&quot;. If there are any unsaved changes, a confirmation popup will appear that says &quot;Some ChangeSets for Cuis core have unsaved changes. If you continue, they would be lost. Do you really want to exit Cuis without saving the image?&quot; Click &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;.</p><p>While the classes and methods provided by a base image can be modified, it is not a good idea to do so because there won't be an easy way to apply those changes to a fresh image.</p><p>It is better to create new subclasses of provided classes that override methods and save the subclasses in a new package or &quot;file out&quot;. Doing this enables installing the new package or file out in a fresh image.</p><p>There are three ways to discover the file path of the current image:</p><ol><li>Hover over the task bar at the bottom of the World window. This opens a Text Editor window that displays the current version of Cuis Smalltalk, the latest update number, and the file path of the current image.</li><li>Open the World menu and select Help...About this System... This opens a Text Editor window that displays a description of Cuis Smalltalk. It also displays a popup containing the same information as described above.</li><li>Open a Workspace, enter <code>DirectoryEntry smalltalkImageDirectory</code>, and &quot;Print it&quot;. This outputs the directory path of the current image without its file name.</li></ol></article>
