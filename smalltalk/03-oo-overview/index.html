For example, an object can hold the <code>center</code> and <code>radius</code> of a circle. In Smalltalk, these are referred to as instance variables.</p><p>A class is often used as template for creating instances of the class which are referred to as objects. For example, a <code>Circle</code> class can be defined.</p><p>A class can define:</p><ul><li><p>class methods that are used to create instances</p><p>For example, as class method can take a name and breed and return a new object that uses those.</p></li><li><p>class variables whose values are shared by all instances</p><p>For example, a class variable can hold the timestamp at which the last <code>Circle</code> object was created.</p></li><li><p>class methods that operate on class variables</p><p>For example, a class method can return a formatted string representation of the timestamp held in a class variable.</p></li><li><p>instance variables whose values are unique to each instances</p></li><li><p>instance methods that operate on instance variables</p></li></ul><p>Classes can inherit from other classes to define a &quot;kind of&quot; relationship and share both data and methods. For example, the classes <code>Square</code> and <code>Circle</code> can inherit from the class <code>Shape</code>.</p><p>Most OO languages, such as Smalltalk, only allow a class to inherit from one other class. But there are languages that support multiple inheritance.</p><p>When a class <code>A</code> inherits from a class <code>B</code>, we say that <code>A</code> is a subclass of <code>B</code> and <code>B</code> is a superclass of <code>A</code>.</p><p>When a class <code>A</code> is a subclass of a class <code>B</code>:</p><ul><li>Instance methods in <code>A</code> can access all the instance variables in <code>B</code>.</li><li>Instance methods in <code>A</code> can invoke all the instance methods in <code>B</code>.</li><li>Class methods in <code>A</code> can access all the class variables in <code>B</code>.</li><li>Class methods in <code>A</code> can invoke all the class methods in <code>B</code>.</li></ul><p>Polymorphism is the ability to select the implementation of a method to invoke based on the kind of object on which it is invoked. For example, the <code>Shape</code> class can require its subclasses to implement an <code>area</code> method. The classes <code>Square</code> and <code>Circle</code> can each define the <code>area</code> method to compute the value differently.</p><p>A variable can hold a reference to a <code>Shape</code> object which can be an instance of any subclass. When the <code>area</code> method is invoked on that variable, the actual method invoked is determined by the type of the object.</p><p>Some languages, such as Smalltalk, determine the method to invoke at run-time instead of at compile-time. This is referred to as &quot;late binding&quot;.</p><p>A somewhat unique feature of Smalltalk is that methods are invoked through message passing. Rather that directly invoking a method, a message is passed to an object and a lookup process is used to find a corresponding method. Details about this lookup process are presented later.</p></article>
