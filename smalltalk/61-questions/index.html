Try this with the &quot;collatz&quot; method that you added to the Integer class.</li><li>A Smalltalk image contains a set of class definitions, existing objects, and code that implements a GUI for the objects that are graphical. Anything else?</li><li>Code can be saved in an image, a package, or a fileOut. Are those all the options?</li><li>Are packages unique to Cuis Smalltalk?</li><li>Is the only way to save changes to a package to open an &quot;Installed Packages&quot; window, select the package, and click the &quot;save&quot; button?</li><li>What package can you install to get a color picker?</li><li>Are there any linting tools for Smalltalk?</li><li>Learn how to write and distribute command-line utilities/apps in Smalltalk.</li><li>Learn how to write and distribute GUI apps in Smalltalk.</li><li>Learn how to write and distribute web apps in Smalltalk.</li><li>Study the code in the &quot;Morphic-Games-Solitaire&quot; package to see what you can learn from it.</li><li>See <a href="https://squeak.js.org" target="_blank">SqueakJS</a>.</li><li>Learn how to add items to existing menus in the Cuis UI that do something when you select them such as repositioning the currrently active window.</li><li>Consider submitting an update to Cuis that standardizes menu item names. Currently there are three styles:<ul><li>all words lower</li><li>All Words Upper</li><li>Mixture of styles</li></ul></li><li>Does Smalltalk expose its own AST? If so, maybe you can use that to generate code and another programming language from my Smalltalk program.</li><li>Is Morphic 3 only supported in Cuis?</li><li>Does Cuis run on the &quot;OpenSmalltalk Virtual Machine&quot;? Is this the same VM that is used by Squeak and Pharo?</li><li>In a talk by Juan Vuletich, one of his slides says Cuis is &quot;A practical system, used for teaching, Satellite image processing, research in sign, image, and audio processing, research in programming languages, and many other areas of application.&quot; Does this imply that it is not for &quot;normal&quot; application development.</li><li>Can you configure your image so it never starts in full screen mode even if it was saved that way?</li><li>What do you click in a <code>Morph</code> halo to cause it to display its coordinate system axes?</li><li>Some packages are built-in meaning that they are included in the base image of the Smalltalk implementation. Other packages must be downloaded, sometimes by cloning a GitHub repository.</li><li>Formalize your code to generate HTML from an <code>Association</code> object.</li><li>Does &quot;morph removeAll&quot; remove a given <code>Morph</code> and all of its sub morphs?</li><li>Try the Connectors package. Does it work in Cuis Smalltalk or is there a port of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QBRm_hnl7sE?si=w4FDZLfoyMAehZv6">https://youtu.be/QBRm_hnl7sE?si=w4FDZLfoyMAehZv6</a></li><li>Submit a PR for the SVG repository that modifies <code>README.md</code> to explain how to clone the <code>Numerics</code> repository which provides the <code>LinearAlgebra</code> package, and install that.</li><li>Submit a PR to this for the typos you found in <a href="https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook">https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook</a>.</li><li>Try <a href="https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/DatabaseSupport">https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/DatabaseSupport</a>.</li><li>Is there a library of collection types for Smalltalk that support structural sharing for immutability?</li><li>Is there a way to revert changes to more than one method at a time?</li><li>Is there any way to add functionality to a morph without creating a new subclass? For example, I created a subclass of TextEntryMorph just so I could listen for presses of the escape key. Was that really necessary?</li><li>Describe what it means for a morph to be &quot;pluggable&quot;. I think it means that the morph is a subclass of <code>PluggableMorph</code> and can be configured through message sends to change its behavior.</li><li>Is there a way to configure Cuis so class categories and method categories are always alphabetized?</li></ul></article>
