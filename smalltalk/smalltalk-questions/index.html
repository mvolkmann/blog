Try this with the &quot;collatz&quot; method that you added to the Integer class.</p></li><li><p>A Smalltalk image contains a set of class definitions, existing objects, and code that implements a GUI for the objects that are graphical. Anything else?</p></li><li><p>Code can be saved in an image, a package, or a fileOut. Are those all the options?</p></li><li><p>Are packages unique to Cuis Smalltalk?</p></li><li><p>Is the only way to save changes to a package to open an &quot;Installed Packages&quot; window, select the package, and click the &quot;save&quot; button?</p></li><li><p>Do any collection classes support structural sharing for immutability support?</p></li><li><p>What package can you install to get a color picker?</p></li><li><p>Are there any linting tools for Smalltalk?</p></li><li><p>Learn how to write and distribute command-line utilities/apps in Smalltalk.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to write and distribute GUI apps in Smalltalk.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to write and distribute web apps in Smalltalk.</p></li><li><p>Study the code in the &quot;Morphic-Games-Solitaire&quot; package to see what you can learn from it.</p></li><li><p>Is there a String method that does interpolation? I'm imagining something like this: s := 'Player %s is number %d.' interpolate: #('Gretzky' 99).</p></li><li><p>See this! <a href="https://squeak.js.org" target="_blank">SqueakJS</a></p></li><li><p>Learn how to add items to existing menus in the Cuis UI that do something when you select them such as repositioning the currrently active window.</p></li><li><p>Consider submitting an update to Cuis that standardizes menu item names. Currently there are three styles:</p><ul><li>all words lower</li><li>All Words Upper</li><li>Mixture of styles</li></ul></li><li><p>Describe the use of &quot;class instance variables&quot; (not shared with subclasses) which are different from &quot;class variables&quot; (shared with subclasses)? To see them in a System Browser, select a class and click the class button. They will look like this:</p><pre class="language-smalltalk"><code class="language-smalltalk">Dog class<br>    instanceVariableNames<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">''</span></code></pre></li><li><p>Does Smalltalk expose its own AST? If so, maybe you can use that to generate code and another programming language from my Smalltalk program.</p></li><li><p>How can you examine the bytecode for a method?</p></li><li><p>Learn how to draw on a canvas in Cuis using &quot;Morphic 3&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Is Morphic 3 only supported in Cuis?</p></li><li><p>Does Cuis run on the &quot;OpenSmalltalk Virtual Machine&quot;? Is this the same VM that is used by Squeak and Pharo?</p></li><li><p>In a talk by Juan Vuletich, one of his slides says Cuis is &quot;A practical system, used for teaching, Satellite image processing, research in sign, image, and audio processing, research in programming languages, and many other areas of application.&quot; This seems to imply that it is not for &quot;normal&quot; application development.</p></li><li><p>Learn about the Smalltalk &quot;primitive&quot; syntax. For example, the <code>DisplayScreen</code> instance method <code>fullScreenMode:</code> contains <code>&lt;primitive: 233&gt;</code>.</p></li><li><p>Can you configure your image so it never starts in full screen mode even if it was saved that way?</p></li><li><p>What do you click in a morph halo to cause it to display its coordinate system axes?</p></li><li><p>Some packages are built-in meaning that they are included in the distribution of the Smalltalk implementation. Other packages must be downloaded, sometimes by cloning a GitHub repository.</p></li><li><p>Formalize your code to generate HTML from an Association object.</p></li><li><p>Does “morph removeAll” remove a given morph and all of its sub morphs?</p></li><li><p>Another way to browse a class besides pressing cmd-f in the left pane of a system browser and searching for it by name is to enter the name and it workspace and press cmd-b to browse it.</p></li><li><p>Is it more common to include a space after the return caret or not?</p></li><li><p>The protocol of a class is the set of all its instance methods, including those that are inherited from superclasses.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to use all the buttons in a system browser window.</p></li><li><p>The term &quot;extent&quot; in Morphic means the combination of width and height as a Point object.</p></li><li><p>Is &quot;location&quot; a Point object containing X and Y values?</p></li><li><p>Is Cuis Smalltalk the only implementation that supports Unicode characters, TrueType fonts, vector graphics?</p></li><li><p>Try the Connectors package. Does it work in Cuis Smalltalk or is there a port of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/QBRm_hnl7sE?si=w4FDZLfoyMAehZv6">https://youtu.be/QBRm_hnl7sE?si=w4FDZLfoyMAehZv6</a></p></li><li><p>Submit a PR for the SVG repository that modifies <code>README.md</code> to explain how to clone the <code>Numerics</code> repository which provides the <code>LinearAlgebra</code> package, and install that.</p></li><li><p>Submit a PR to this for the typos you found in <a href="https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook">https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/TheCuisBook</a>.</p></li><li><p>Try <a href="https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/DatabaseSupport">https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/DatabaseSupport</a>.</p></li><li><p>Is there a library of collection types for Smalltalk that support structural sharing for immutability?</p></li><li><p>Is there a way to revert changes to more than one method at a time?</p></li><li><p>Where is the <code>new</code> method defined? Does that explicitly call <code>initialize</code> on the newly created object?</p></li></ul></article>
