To open one, select an object reference or place the cursor immediately after it and press cmd-i (Inpect it).</p><p><img alt="Cuis Inspect window" style="width: 40%" src="/blog/assets/cuis-inspect-window.png?v=1.1.1"></p><p>Clicking an item in the top left pane, displays related information in the top right pane.</p><ul><li>Click &quot;self&quot; to display the class name of the object.</li><li>Click &quot;all inst vars&quot; to display a list of all instance variables and their values.</li><li>Click the name of an instance to display its current value.</li></ul><p>The bottom pane can be used to enter and execute Smalltalk expressions. Instance variables can be directly accessed and where <code>self</code> refers to the object being inspected. For example, when the object is a <code>Morph</code>:</p><ul><li>To get the value of the <code>color</code> instance variable, enter <code>color</code> or <code>self color</code> and press cmd-p (Print it).</li><li>To set the value of the <code>color</code> instance variable, enter <code>color := Color red</code> or <code>self color: Color red</code> and press cmd-d (Do it).</li></ul><p>Inspector windows are live, so changes made to the instance variables are reflected.</p><p>Let's walk through an example:</p><ol><li>Open the World menu and select &quot;New Morph...&quot;.</li><li>Select &quot;Basic...Boxed Morph&quot;. An orange rectangle will appear, attached to the mouse cursor.</li><li>Move to where you want to place it and click to drop it.</li><li>cmd-click on the <code>Morph</code> to open its halo.</li><li>Click the blue button on the top row.</li><li>Select &quot;debug...inspect morph&quot; to open an Inspect window for the object that represents that <code>Morph</code>.</li><li>Click the <code>color</code> instance variable and note that the value is a <code>Color</code> object.</li><li>Select the name &quot;Color&quot; and press cmb-b (Browse it) to open a System Browser focused on the <code>Color</code> class.</li><li>Click the &quot;class&quot; button to see a list of the class methods in the <code>Color</code> class.</li><li>Click the method category &quot;named colors&quot; and note that one of the methods is &quot;red&quot;.</li><li>Back in the Inspect window, click in the bottom pane.</li><li>Enter <code>color := Color red</code> and &quot;Do it&quot;.</li><li>Note that the value displayed in the top right pane updates, but the fill color of the <code>Morph</code> does not update.</li><li>Enter <code>self color: Color red</code> and &quot;Do it&quot;. This time the value displayed in the top right pane updates AND the fill color of the <code>Morph</code> updates. The reason is that the <code>color:</code> method in the <code>BoxedMorph</code> class sends the <code>#redrawNeeded</code> message to <code>self</code> which triggers the <code>Morph</code> to redraw itself with the updated color.</li></ol><h2 id="explore-windows" tabindex="-1">Explore Windows</h2><p>Explore windows display an object tree starting at a specific object. Select an object reference or place the cursor immediately after it and press cmd-shift-i (Explore it). Click the disclosure triangles to drill down into instance variable values.</p><p>Use the bottom pane to enter and execute Smalltalk expressions where <code>self</code> refers to the selected object in the top pane.</p><p><img alt="Cuis Explore window" style="width: 40%" src="/blog/assets/cuis-explore-window.png?v=1.1.1"></p><h2 id="system-browsers" tabindex="-1">System Browsers</h2><p>A System Browser can be used to examine, create, modify and delete class categories, classes, method categories, and methods. This includes those provided by the base image, those provided by installed packages, and those you create.</p><p>Class and method category names can contain spaces.</p><p>To open a System Browser, open the World menu and select Open...Browser. Alternatively, type a class name (ex. String) in a Workspace window and press cmd-b (Browse it) to open a System Browser with that class already selected.</p><p>For more detail, see <a href="https://cuis-smalltalk.github.io/TheCuisBook/A-brief-introduction-to-the-system-Browser.html" target="_blank">A brief introduction to the System Browser</a>.</p><h3 id="system-browser-ui" tabindex="-1">System Browser UI</h3><p><img alt="Cuis System Browser" style="width: 100%" src="/blog/assets/cuis-system-browser-window.png?v=1.1.1"></p><p>System Browsers contain four rows.</p><ul><li><p>The first (top) row contains four panes for displaying and operating on lists of class categories, classes, message categories, and methods. Clicking an item toggles whether it is selected.</p><p>Selecting a class category in the first pane displays the classes in that category in the second pane. For example, the class <code>String</code> is in the class category <code>Kernel-Text</code>. Class categories include those provided by the base image (ex. &quot;Ordered - Sequenceable&quot;), those defined by installed packages, and class categories you create (used to save your code outside the image).</p><p>Selecting a class in the second pane displays message categories for the class in the third pane. Example message category names include &quot;accessing&quot;, &quot;comparing&quot;, &quot;copying&quot;, &quot;converting&quot;, &quot;enumerating&quot;, &quot;printing&quot;, and &quot;testing&quot;. There is a separate set of method categories for instance methods and class methods.</p><p>The second pane contains three buttons at the bottom. Clicking the &quot;instance&quot; or &quot;class&quot; button causes the remaining panes to display information about instance or class methods, respectively. Clicking the &quot;?&quot; button shows the class comment for the select class.</p><p>Selecting a message category (a.k.a protocol) in the third pane displays methods in that category in the fourth pane. The top message category, provided by default, is &quot;-- all --&quot;. If no message category is selected, or if &quot;-- all --&quot; is selected, all the methods in all categories are listed.</p><p>The list of methods in the fourth pane only includes methods that are directly implemented by the class, not those define in superclasses that are available via inheritance. To see all available methods, open a Protocol Browser.</p><p>The names in the class category and method category panes are not sorted alphabetically by default. To sort class categories, hover over that pane and press cmd-shift-a (alphabetize). To sort method categories, hover over that pane and press cmd-a (alphabetize). The reason for the shortcut key difference is that in the class category pane, cmd-a is used for &quot;add item...&quot;.</p><p>To scroll any list to the first item that begins with a given letter, over over the lsit and type the letter.</p><p>The global <code>SystemOrganization</code> refers to an instance of the <code>SystemOrganizer</code> class. To get an <code>Array</code> of symbols that are the names of all current class categories, evaluate <code>SystemOrganization categories</code>.</p></li><li><p>The second row displays a message describing the item selected in the top row.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Item Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>class category</td><td># of classes in the category, total # of instance and class methods</td></tr><tr><td>class</td><td># of instance and class methods defined in the class</td></tr><tr><td>method category</td><td># of methods</td></tr><tr><td>method</td><td># of message sends, implementors, and senders</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><p>The third row contains a series of buttons that can be clicked to open other windows that show information related to the selected item. One exception is the &quot;show...&quot; button, described below.</p><p>The &quot;browse&quot; button opens a new System Browser focused on the currently selected class, message category, or method. This enables maintaining the view in the current System Browser and navigating somewhere relative to that location in a new System Browser.</p><p>The &quot;senders&quot; button opens a &quot;Senders of&quot; window that lists all the methods that send a message to invoke the selected method. Selecting one displays its implementation in the bottom pane. If no method is selected, a text entry will be displayed to prompt for a method selector.</p><p>The &quot;implementors&quot; button opens an &quot;Implementors of&quot; window that lists all the classes that implement the selected method. Selecting one displays its implementation in the bottom pane. Another way to open this window is to select a method name in any editing pane such as a Workspace and press cmd-m (Implementors of it).</p><p>The &quot;versions&quot; button opens a &quot;Recent versions&quot; window that displays a list of time stamps for recent versions of the method. TODO: Does this only include changes made since the current image was opened? Clicking a time stamp displays that version of the code in the bottom pane.</p><p>If one of the buttons &quot;lineDiffs&quot;, &quot;wordDiffs&quot;, &quot;linePrettyDiffs&quot;, or &quot;wordPrettyDiffs&quot; is pressed, it will show differences between that version and the current version. The two &quot;line diff&quot; options show whole line differences. The two &quot;word diff&quot; options show individual word differences. The two &quot;pretty&quot; options show the code in its formatted form. To stop showing differences, click the selected diff button to toggle it off.</p><p>Code added by the selected version will be in green. Code removed by the selected version will be in red. Click the &quot;revert&quot; button to restore that version as the current version of the code. The &quot;compare to current&quot; button displays the same information as the lineDiffs button, but in a new window.</p><p>The &quot;inheritance&quot; button opens an &quot;Inheritance of&quot; window that shows the superclass methods of the same name that are invoked by the selected method, all the way up the inheritance hierarchy.</p><p>The &quot;hierarchy&quot; button opens a Hierarchy Browser that shows the inheritance hierarchy of the current class. This includes all superclass and subclasses of the current class.</p><p>The &quot;inst vars&quot; button displays a popup list containing all the instance variables in the current class. Clicking one of them opens an &quot;Accesses to&quot; window that lists all the methods that use the instance variable it its top pane. Clicking on a method displays its code in the bottom pane.</p><p>The &quot;class vars&quot; button displays a popup list containing all the class variables in the current class. Clicking one of them opens a new &quot;Users of&quot; window that lists all the methods that use the class variable in its top pane. Clicking on a method displays its code in the bottom pane (fourth row).</p><p>The &quot;show...&quot; button displays a popup list of ways the selected item can be displayed in the bottom pane. Each option is represented by a checkbox, but only one can be selected.</p><p>The default option is &quot;source&quot; which merely displays the source code of the selected method. This is typically the desired choice.</p><p>Selecting &quot;documentation&quot; only displays the signature and comment for the selected item. When there is no commment, it displays &quot;Has no comment&quot;.</p><p>Seleting &quot;prettyPrint&quot; displays the code for a method in a nicely formatted way, but doesn't actually modify the code. I wish it did.</p><p>Selecting &quot;lineDiffs&quot;, &quot;wordDiffs&quot;, &quot;linePrettyDiffs&quot;, or &quot;wordPrettyDiffs&quot; has the same functionality as described earlier for &quot;Recent versions&quot; windows.</p><p>Selecting &quot;decompile&quot; displays code that is similar to the source code, but variable names are changed. Parameter variable names are replaced by <code>arg1</code>, <code>arg2</code>, and so on. Local variable names are replaced by <code>temp1</code>, <code>temp2</code>, and so on. It's not clear when this would be useful.</p><p>Selecting &quot;byteCodes&quot; displays the byte codes generated by the method source code. This could be useful for evaluating the efficency of the code.</p><p>Methods categories used by a given class are stored in its provided instance variable <code>organization</code>.</p></li><li><p>The fourth row displays information about the selected item based on the checkbox that is selected for the &quot;show...&quot; button. By default it displays Smalltalk code for the selected item and can be used to edit the code. When there are unsaved code changes in this pane, a thin, red border appears around it. Press cmd-s (Accept) to save the changes and the thin, red border will disappear.</p></li></ul><p>To open a new System Browser for a class whose name appears in a System Browser, select the name and press cmb-d (Browse it). Currently there is no way to request for the current System Browser to be reused for browsing a selected class name.</p><h3 id="code-formatting" tabindex="-1">Code Formatting</h3><p>To automatically display formatted code, enter the following in a Workspace and &quot;Do it&quot;:</p><pre class="language-smalltalk"><code class="language-smalltalk">Preferences at<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token symbol">#browseWithPrettyPrint</span> put<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span></code></pre><p>This does not take effect in existing windows such as System Browsers, but does in newly opened windows.
