This message is handled by an instance method of the class <code>Class</code>.</p><p>The <code>subclass:</code> keyword takes a symbol. The remaining keywords all take strings. All the keywords must be supplied, even if their value is an empty string. The following is an example class definition.</p><pre class="language-smalltalk"><code class="language-smalltalk">Object subclass<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token symbol">#Dog</span><br>    instanceVariableNames<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'breed name'</span><br>    classVariableNames<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">''</span><br>    poolDictionaries<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">''</span><br>    category<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'Volkmann'</span></code></pre><p>Programming languages use many terms to describe data that is encapsulated by objects created from a class. Examples include &quot;attribute&quot;, &quot;property&quot;, and &quot;field&quot;. Smalltalk calls these &quot;instance variables&quot;.</p><p>Instance variables are described by a single <code>String</code> where the names are separated by spaces. The names must begin lowercase.</p><p>Each class is a associated with a category. Classes provided by the image are in categories such as &quot;Collections&quot;, &quot;Kernel&quot;, &quot;Morphic&quot;, &quot;System&quot;, &quot;Tools&quot;, &quot;UI&quot;, and many more. If a new class definition is saved with an empty string category, it will be changed to 'as yet unclassified'.</p><p>Classes in the &quot;Kernel&quot; category are considered to be fundamental classes. Examples include <code>Date</code>, <code>BlockClosure</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Object</code>, and <code>String</code>.</p><p>Pool dictionaries enable sharing data between related classes. They reside in the <code>Smalltalk</code> dictionary. To create a pool dictionary named &quot;MyPool&quot;, enter the following in a Workspace and &quot;Do it&quot;: <code>Smalltalk at: #MyPool put: (Dictionary new)</code>. Then refer to it from any number of classes with <code>poolDictionaries: 'MyPool'</code>. It is common for a class not have any pool dictionaries.</p><p>All classes are global and there is no namespacing. Class names are added to the global variable <code>Smalltalk</code> which is a <code>SystemDictionary</code>. This requires all class names to be unique. Typically a common prefix, perhaps 2 or 3 uppercase letters, is added to a set of related class names in order to make the unique. Lack of namespacing is seen by some as a weakness of Smalltalk.</p><p>All classes inherit from one other class, except <code>ProtoObject</code> which is the highest superclass of all classes.</p><p>To get the superclass of a class, send it the <code>#superclass</code> method. For example, <code>Integer superclass</code> returns <code>Number</code>.</p><p>Instance variables can only be directly accessed by methods in the same class. To expose them outside the class, add getter and setter (optional) methods. For example, if <code>score</code> is an instance variable then the following is a getter method for it. By convention, the name of getter and setter methods is the same as the name of the associated instance variable, but this is not required.</p><pre class="language-smalltalk"><code class="language-smalltalk">score<br>    <span class="token operator">^</span>score<br><br>score<span class="token punctuation">:</span> aNumber<br>    score <span class="token operator">:=</span> aNumber</code></pre><p>As shown above, another convention is for variables associated with keyword messages to indicate their expected type.</p><p>To find a class without needing to know its class category:</p><ul><li>Press shift-return OR hover over the top, first column in a System Browser and press cmd-f.</li><li>Enter part of the class name.</li><li>Select a class name from the popup list that appears.</li><li>If shift-return was pressed, a new System Browser will open to display the selected class. If cmd-f was pressed in an existing System Browser, the selected class will be displayed there.</li></ul></article>
