It runs on Mac computers (macOS), iPads (iPadOS), iPhones (iOS), and Apple Watches (watchOS). The data is synced across all these devices.</p><p>Reminders can be added using Siri. Just speak phrases in forms like the following:</p><ul><li>Remind me to {task}</li><li>Add a reminder to my {list-name} list to {task}</li><li>Remind me to {task} at {time} today</li><li>Remind me to {task} at {time} on {day-or-date}</li><li>Remind me to {task} on {date} at {time}</li><li>Remind me to {task} when I get home</li><li>Remind me to {task} when I get to work</li></ul><p>By default, reminders are added to your default list. This is specified in Settings for the Reminders app and defaults to &quot;Inbox&quot;.</p><p>The instructions below are primarily focused on using Reminders in iPadOS. The same functionality is available on macOS and iOS, but may be organized slightly differently.</p><p>In iPadOS and macOS, the Reminders app displays a left nav area and a main area. The left nav area displays large buttons for navigating to &quot;pinned lists&quot;, followed by the names of non-pinned lists. Tapping a list button or name opens the list in the main area.</p><h2 id="lists" tabindex="-1">Lists</h2><p>Reminders can manage any number of task lists.</p><p>To create a new list:</p><ul><li>Tap &quot;Add List&quot; at the bottom of the left nav.</li><li>Enter a name for the list.</li><li>Select a list type (Standard, Groceries, or Smart List).</li><li>Select a color.</li><li>Select an icon.
