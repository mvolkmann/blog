The cursor can be positioned by using the arrow keys or clicking anywhere in a command. Any text can be selected, copied, and pasted.</p><p>Warp currently only supports the shells Zsh, Bash, and Fish, and it does so without any configuration. If your default shell is not one of these, Warp will default to Zsh. The Warp team has stated that they would like to support Nushell in the future.</p><p>Warp is implemented in Rust which makes it very fast. From the Warp FAQ, &quot;The UI is built on our own rendering layer that leverages lower-level graphics APIs like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/?v=1.0.20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Metal</a>.&quot;</p><p>Warp uses GPU-acceleration. From the Warp FAQ, &quot;Picking GPU acceleration has allowed us to be a way over 60fps on a 4K screen.&quot;</p><p>Vim keybindings are not currently supported, but the Warp team has stated that they want to add support. See <a href="https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/159?v=1.0.20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue 159</a>.</p><h2 id="installing" tabindex="-1">Installing</h2><p>To install Warp using Homebrew, enter <code>brew install warp</code>. This creates <code>Warp.app</code> in your <code>Applications</code> directory.</p><h2 id="running" tabindex="-1">Running</h2><p>Double-click <code>Warp.app</code> in your <code>Applications</code> directory to launch it. The first launch will prompt you to sign up.</p><p>When an update is available an &quot;Update Available&quot; button will appear on the right side of the title bar. Clicking displays a popup with an &quot;Install update&quot; option that lists the new version number. Click it download the new version.</p><p>When quitting Warp if there are any processes running inside it, a dialog will appear allowing you to verify that you really want to quit which will kill the processes. Click the &quot;Show running processes&quot; button to see a list of the processes.</p><h2 id="hierarchy" tabindex="-1">Hierarchy</h2><p>Warp uses the terms window, tab, pane, and block. These have the following relationships:</p><ul><li>A windows holds tabs.</li><li>A tab holds panes.</li><li>A pane holds blocks.</li><li>A block holds a shell command and its output.</li></ul><h2 id="windows" tabindex="-1">Windows</h2><p>Each window can contain any number of tabs.</p><p>To open a new window, select File ... New Window or press cmd-n.</p><h2 id="tabs" tabindex="-1">Tabs</h2><p>Each tab can contain any number of panes.</p><p>To open a new tab, click the &quot;+&quot; to the right of the last open tab.</p><p>To rename a tab, right-click it, select &quot;Rename&quot;, enter the new name, and press the return key.</p><p>To change the color of the bottom border and background gradient of a tab, right-click it, and select one of the six theme colors at the bottom of the popup.</p><p>To navigate to the tab to the right, press cmd-}.</p><p>To navigate to the tab to the left, press cmd-{.</p><p>To reorder tabs, drag them left or right.</p><h2 id="panes" tabindex="-1">Panes</h2><p>Each pane can hold any number of blocks.</p><p>To create a new pane, right-click and select one of the &quot;Split pane&quot; options to open a new pane on the right, left, down (bottom), or up (top).</p><p>I defined the following keyboard shortcuts of the form cmd-shift-{arrow-key} to simplify creating new panes:</p><ul><li>right arrow - Split pane right</li><li>left arrow - Split pane left</li><li>down arrow - Split pane down</li><li>up arrow - Split pane up</li></ul><p>To close the currently focused pane, enter &quot;exit&quot; or press cmd-w. To close any pane, right-click in it and select &quot;Close pane&quot;. Closing the last pane in a tab closes the tab. Closing the last tab in a window closes the window.</p><p>To navigate to the next pane, press cmd-].</p><p>To navigate to the previous pane, press cmd-[.</p><p>To navigate to a pane in a specific direction, press cmd-option-{arrow-key}.</p><p>To resize panes, drag a divider line or press cmd-ctrl-{arrow-key}.</p><p>To temporarily change the current pane to occupy the entire window, open the command palette and select &quot;Toggle Maximize Active Pane&quot; or press cmd-shift-return. To undo this, execute the same command again.</p><p>To clear all the blocks in the current pane, open the command palette and select &quot;Clear Blocks&quot;, enter the Warp command &quot;clear block&quot;, or press cmd-k.</p><p>To see a list of all current panes across all tabs, press cmd-shift-p. This opens a dialog that lists the panes. Alternatively, press cmd-p to open the command palette and type &quot;@&quot;. Each pane is described by providing its current working directory and the last command executed in it. To navigate to one of the panes, click its description.</p><p>Currently there is no way to swap the positions of two panes within their tab.</p><h2 id="blocks" tabindex="-1">Blocks</h2><p>Entering a shell command creates a new &quot;block&quot;.</p><p>Blocks are divided by thin horizontal lines. By default there is some vertical space on both sizes of the lines. To remove this space, open Settings, select Appearance, and toggle the &quot;Compact mode&quot; option to be on.</p><p>There are two ways to select a previous block:</p><ol><li>Scroll up until it is visible and click it.</li><li>Click any block and use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to it.</li></ol><p>There are many Warp commands that operate on a block. To execute such a command, right-click anywhere in the block or click the vertical ellipsis in the upper-right corner of the block.</p><p>Block commands include:</p><ul><li>Copy Command</li><li>Copy Output</li><li>Copy Both (the shell command and its output)</li><li>Create Permalink... (see the &quot;Permalink&quot; section below)</li><li>Copy Prompt</li><li>Copy Working Directory</li><li>Copy Git Branch</li><li>Find Within Block - searches only within the block instead of the entire pane</li><li>Toggle Bookmark</li><li>Split pane right - cmd-d; I changed to cmd-shift-right-arrow</li><li>Split pane left - I added cmd-shift-left-arrow</li><li>Split pane down - cmd-shift-d; I changed to cmd-shift-down-arrow</li><li>Split pane up - I added cmd-shift-up-arrow</li><li>Toggle maximize pane</li><li>Close pane</li></ul><h2 id="commands" tabindex="-1">Commands</h2><p>When entering a shell command or Warp command, recognized commands are displayed in green and unrecognized commands are underlined with a red, dashed line.</p><p>For recognized commands, a suggested completion may appear in dimmed text. To accept the suggestion, press the right arrow key.</p><p>To execute the entered command, press the return key.</p><p>To enter multiple commands on separate lines, press ctrl-j (runs the &quot;Insert Newline&quot; command) after each command except the last. Pressing the return key executes all of the commands and displays the output of each command.</p><p>To see a brief description of a command, subcommand, or flag in a popup provided by the &quot;Command Inspector&quot;, hover over it.</p><p>To recall a command previously entered in the current pane, repeatedly press the up arrow key until the desired command is highlighted. Press the return key to execute it.</p><p>To search command history, workflows, and AI commands, press ctrl-r. To limit the search to one of these three categories, click the &quot;history&quot;, &quot;workflows&quot;, or &quot;AI command search&quot; button. Then enter text to perform a fuzzy search. For example, entering &quot;start&quot; will find any command containing those letters in that order, but not necessarily together. This would match &quot;fastlane screenshots&quot;.</p><p>A block cannot be re-executed. However, you can:</p><ul><li>right-click a block</li><li>select &quot;Copy Command&quot;</li><li>press cmd-v to paste it into the input area at the bottom of the pane</li><li>press the return key to execute it</li></ul><h2 id="command-editing" tabindex="-1">Command Editing</h2><p>There are many keyboard shortcuts that trigger text editing commands. The following table summarizes the most useful shortcuts.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Keyboard Shortcut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Clear Command Editor</td><td>ctrl-c</td></tr><tr><td>Clear Screen</td><td>ctrl-l</td></tr><tr><td>Insert Newline</td><td>ctrl-j</td></tr><tr><td>Move to Start of Line</td><td>cmd-left-arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Move to End of Line</td><td>cmd-right-arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Select All</td><td>cmd-a</td></tr><tr><td>Delete All Left</td><td>cmd-delete</td></tr><tr><td>Delete All Right</td><td>cmd-fn-delete</td></tr><tr><td>Delete Word Left</td><td>option-delete</td></tr><tr><td>Delete Word Right</td><td>option-fn-delete</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For more keyboard shortcuts, see the <a href="https://docs.warp.dev/features/keyboard-shortcuts#input-editor?v=1.0.20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>.</p><h2 id="ai-commands" tabindex="-1">AI Commands</h2><p>To generate a shell command using an AI search, press ctrl-`. Enter English text describing the desired command and press the return key. For example, entering &quot;delete local git branch&quot; suggests &quot;git branch -d branch_name&quot;. To accept this suggestion, click the &quot;Input Command&quot; button or press cmd-return. Replace any placeholders (such as <code>branch_name</code> above) and press the return key to execute the command.</p><p>Sometimes the suggested commands are correct for Linux and not macOS. To get macOS equivalents, add &quot;on mac&quot; to the English description.</p><h2 id="workflows" tabindex="-1">Workflows</h2><p>Workflows are named sets of shell commands (typically just one) that are parameterized. They are similar to snippets in code editors.</p><p>Each workflow is defined by a <code>.yaml</code> file.</p><p>To search for a workflow, press ctrl-shift-r. In the popup that appears, select a category in the left nav such as &quot;git&quot;. Then click one of the workflows to copy it to the current block. Replace any placeholders and press the return key to execute the workflow.</p><p>Warp ships with over 100 predefined workflows.</p><p>To install additional workflows, see the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/warpdotdev/workflows?v=1.0.20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warpdotdev/workflows</a>.</p><p>To create custom workflows, see <a href="https://docs.warp.dev/features/entry/workflows#creating-custom-workflows?v=1.0.20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Creating Custom Workflows</a>.</p><h2 id="selecting-text" tabindex="-1">Selecting Text</h2><p>To select text, perhaps to copy it, drag over it as you would in most editors.
