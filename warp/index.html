The cursor can be positioned by using the arrow keys or clicking anywhere in a command. Any text can be selected, copied, and pasted.</p><p>Warp is implemented in Rust.</p><h2 id="hierarchy" tabindex="-1">Hierarchy</h2><p>Windows hold tabs.</p><p>Tabs hold panes.</p><p>Panes hold blocks.</p><p>Blocks hold a command and its output.</p><h2 id="installing" tabindex="-1">Installing</h2><p>To install Warp using Homebrew, enter <code>brew install warp</code>.
