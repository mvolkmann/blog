The cursor can be positioned by using the arrow keys or clicking anywhere in a command. Any text can be selected, copied, and pasted.</p><p>Warp currently only supports the shells Zsh, Bash, and Fish, and it does so without any configuration. If your default shell is not one of these, Warp will default to Zsh. The Warp team has stated that they would like to support Nushell in the future.</p><p>Warp is implemented in Rust.</p><p>Vim keybindings are not currently supported, but the Warp team has stated that they want to add support. See <a href="https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/159?v=1.0.20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue 159</a>.</p><h2 id="hierarchy" tabindex="-1">Hierarchy</h2><p>Windows hold tabs.</p><p>Tabs hold panes.</p><p>Panes hold blocks.</p><p>Blocks hold a command and its output.</p><h2 id="installing" tabindex="-1">Installing</h2><p>To install Warp using Homebrew, enter <code>brew install warp</code>. This creates <code>Warp.app</code> in your <code>Applications</code> directory.</p><h2 id="running" tabindex="-1">Running</h2><p>Double-click <code>Warp.app</code> in your <code>Applications</code> directory to launch it. The first launch will prompt you to sign up.</p><p>When quitting Warp if there are any processes running in blocks, a dialog will appear allowing you to verify that you really want to quit which will kill the processes. Click the &quot;Show running processes&quot; button to see a list of the processes.</p><h2 id="settings" tabindex="-1">Settings</h2><p>To view and modify settings, select Warp ... Settings ... Settings or press cmd-,.</p><p>The left nav of the Settings dialog contains the following sections:</p><ul><li><p>Account</p><p>This displays the logged in username and current version of Warp.</p></li><li><p>Appearance</p><p>When &quot;Sync with OS&quot; is on, Warp switches between light and dark mode based on the current OS setting. It is off by default.</p><p>The &quot;Window Opacity&quot; can be adjusted to enable seeing content behind Warp windows. It is 100% by default.</p><p>When the Panes &quot;Dim inactive panes&quot; is on, all panes except the current one are dimmed to make it clear which pane is active. It is off by default.</p><p>When the Blocks &quot;Compact mode&quot; is on, the vertical space around the horizontal lines that separate blocks is removed. It is off by default.</p><p>In the Text section, the &quot;Terminal font&quot;, &quot;Font size&quot;, and &quot;Line height&quot; can be set.

However, processes that were running will not be automatically restarted.</p><p>It is also possible to save multiple &quot;launch configurations&quot; so a specific one can be used in the future. To save the current configuration, open the command palette and select the &quot;Save Current Configuration&quot; command. This opens a dialog containing a &quot;Save Configuration&quot; button.
