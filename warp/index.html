The cursor can be positioned by using the arrow keys or clicking anywhere in a command. Any text can be selected, copied, and pasted.</p><p>Warp currently only supports the shells Zsh, Bash, and Fish, and it does so without any configuration. If your default shell is not one of these, Warp will default to Zsh. The Warp team has stated that they would like to support Nushell in the future.</p><p>Warp is implemented in Rust which makes it very fast. From the Warp FAQ, &quot;The UI is built on our own rendering layer that leverages lower-level graphics APIs like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Metal</a>.&quot;</p><p>Warp uses GPU-acceleration. From the Warp FAQ, &quot;Picking GPU acceleration has allowed us to be a way over 60fps on a 4K screen.&quot;</p><p>Vim keybindings are not currently supported, but the Warp team has stated that they want to add support. See <a href="https://github.com/warpdotdev/warp/issues/159?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue 159</a>.</p><h2 id="installing" tabindex="-1">Installing</h2><p>To install Warp using Homebrew, enter <code>brew install warp</code>. This creates <code>Warp.app</code> in your <code>Applications</code> directory.</p><h2 id="running" tabindex="-1">Running</h2><p>Double-click <code>Warp.app</code> in your <code>Applications</code> directory to launch it. The first launch will prompt you to sign up.</p><p>When an update is available an &quot;Update Available&quot; button will appear on the right side of the title bar. Clicking displays a popup with an &quot;Install update&quot; option that lists the new version number. Click it download the new version.</p><p>When quitting Warp if there are any processes running inside it, a dialog will appear allowing you to verify that you really want to quit which will kill the processes. Click the &quot;Show running processes&quot; button to see a list of the processes.</p><h2 id="help" tabindex="-1">Help</h2><p>To get help on using Warp, open the &quot;Warp Essentials&quot; panel by clicking the button on the right side of the title bar. This contains four sections titled &quot;What's New?&quot;, &quot;Getting Started&quot;, &quot;Maximize Warp&quot;, and &quot;Advanced Setup&quot;.</p><p><img alt="Warp Essentials panel" style="width: 50%" src="/blog/assets/warp-essentials-panel.png?v=1.1.1" title="Warp Essentials panel"></p><p>To view &quot;Keyboard Shortcuts&quot;, click the keyboard icon.</p><p>To open the Settings dialog, click the gear icon.</p><p>For online help, click &quot;Docs&quot; at the bottom of the &quot;Warp Essentials&quot; panel or browse <a href="https://docs.warp.dev?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warp Documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="hierarchy" tabindex="-1">Hierarchy</h2><p>Warp uses the terms window, tab, pane, and block. These have the following relationships:</p><ul><li>A windows holds tabs.</li><li>A tab holds panes.</li><li>A pane holds blocks.</li><li>A block holds a shell command and its output.</li></ul><h2 id="windows" tabindex="-1">Windows</h2><p>Each window can contain any number of tabs.</p><p>To open a new window, select File ... New Window or press cmd-n.</p><p>To move a window to a different monitor, select one of the &quot;Move to&quot; options on the Window menu.</p><p>To switch to full-screen mode, select &quot;Enter Full Screen&quot; from the Window menu or press fn-f. To exit full-screen mode, hover over the top of the window and click the green circle or press fn-f again.</p><h2 id="tabs" tabindex="-1">Tabs</h2><p>Each tab can contain any number of panes.</p><p>To open a new tab, click the &quot;+&quot; to the right of the last open tab or press cmd-t.</p><p>To rename a tab, right-click it, select &quot;Rename&quot;, enter the new name, and press the return key.</p><p>To change the color of the bottom border and background gradient of a tab, right-click it, and select one of the six theme colors at the bottom of the popup.</p><p>To navigate to the tab to the right, press cmd-}.</p><p>To navigate to the tab to the left, press cmd-{.</p><p>To reorder tabs, drag them left or right.</p><p>Dragging a directory from the Finder onto the Warp app dock icon opens a new tab in that directory where the title is the directory path.</p><h2 id="panes" tabindex="-1">Panes</h2><p>Each pane can hold any number of blocks.</p><p>To create a new pane, right-click and select one of the &quot;Split pane&quot; options to open a new pane on the right, left, down (bottom), or up (top).</p><p>I defined the following keyboard shortcuts of the form cmd-shift-{arrow-key} to simplify creating new panes:</p><ul><li>right arrow - Split pane right</li><li>left arrow - Split pane left</li><li>down arrow - Split pane down</li><li>up arrow - Split pane up</li></ul><p>To close the currently focused pane, enter &quot;exit&quot; or press cmd-w. To close any pane, right-click in it and select &quot;Close pane&quot;. Closing the last pane in a tab closes the tab. Closing the last tab in a window closes the window.</p><p>To navigate to the next pane, press cmd-].</p><p>To navigate to the previous pane, press cmd-[.</p><p>To navigate to a pane in a specific direction, press cmd-option-{arrow-key}.</p><p>To resize panes, drag a divider line or press cmd-ctrl-{arrow-key}.</p><p>To temporarily change the current pane to occupy the entire window, open the command palette and select &quot;Toggle Maximize Active Pane&quot; or press cmd-shift-return. To undo this, execute the same command again.</p><p>To see a list of all current panes across all tabs, press cmd-shift-p. This opens a dialog that lists the panes. Alternatively, press cmd-p to open the command palette and type &quot;@&quot;. Each pane is described by providing its current working directory and the last command executed in it. To navigate to one of the panes, click its description.</p><p>Currently there is no way to swap the positions of two panes within their tab.</p><h2 id="blocks" tabindex="-1">Blocks</h2><p>Entering a shell command creates a new &quot;block&quot;.</p><p>Blocks are divided by thin horizontal lines. By default there is some vertical space on both sizes of the lines. To remove this space, open Settings, select Appearance, and toggle the &quot;Compact mode&quot; option to be on.</p><p>There are two ways to select a previous block:</p><ol><li>Scroll up until it is visible and click it.</li><li>Click any block and use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to it.</li></ol><p>There are many Warp commands that operate on a block. To execute such a command, open the block command menu by doing one of the following:</p><ul><li>click the vertical ellipsis in the upper-right corner of the block</li><li>right-click anywhere in the block</li><li>select the block and press ctrl-m</li></ul><p>Block commands include:</p><ul><li>Copy Command</li><li>Copy Output</li><li>Copy Both (the shell command and its output)</li><li>Create Permalink...

To accept the suggestion, press the right arrow key.</p><p>To execute the entered command, press the return key.</p><p>Dragging a file or directory from the Finder to the command entry area inserts its full path.</p><p>To enter multiple commands on separate lines, press ctrl-j (runs the &quot;Insert Newline&quot; command) after each command except the last. Pressing the return key executes all of the commands and displays the output of each command.</p><p>To see a brief description of a command, subcommand, or flag in a popup provided by the &quot;Command Inspector&quot;, hover over it.</p><p>To recall a command previously entered in the current pane, repeatedly press the up arrow key until the desired command is highlighted. Press the return key to execute it.</p><p>To search command history, workflows, and AI commands, press ctrl-r. To limit the search to one of these three categories, click the &quot;history&quot;, &quot;workflows&quot;, or &quot;AI command search&quot; button. Then enter text to perform a fuzzy search. For example, entering &quot;start&quot; will find any command containing those letters in that order, but not necessarily together. This would match &quot;fastlane screenshots&quot;.</p><p>A block cannot be re-executed. However, you can:</p><ul><li>right-click a block</li><li>select &quot;Copy Command&quot;</li><li>press cmd-v to paste it into the input area at the bottom of the pane</li><li>press the return key to execute it</li></ul><h2 id="command-editing" tabindex="-1">Command Editing</h2><p>There are many keyboard shortcuts that trigger text editing commands. The following table summarizes the most useful shortcuts.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Keyboard Shortcut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Clear Command Editor</td><td>ctrl-c</td></tr><tr><td>Clear Screen</td><td>ctrl-l</td></tr><tr><td>Insert Newline</td><td>ctrl-j</td></tr><tr><td>Move Backward One Word</td><td>option-left-arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Move Forward One Word</td><td>option-right-arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Move to Start of Line</td><td>cmd-left-arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Move to End of Line</td><td>cmd-right-arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Select All</td><td>cmd-a</td></tr><tr><td>Delete All Left</td><td>cmd-delete</td></tr><tr><td>Delete All Right</td><td>cmd-fn-delete</td></tr><tr><td>Delete Word Left</td><td>option-delete</td></tr><tr><td>Delete Word Right</td><td>option-fn-delete</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For more keyboard shortcuts, see the <a href="https://docs.warp.dev/features/keyboard-shortcuts#input-editor?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>.</p><h2 id="ai-commands" tabindex="-1">AI Commands</h2><p>To generate a shell command using an AI search, enter a # character of press ctrl-`.</p><p><img alt="Warp AI Command Search" style="width: 80%" src="/blog/assets/warp-ai-command-search.png?v=1.1.1" title="Warp AI Command Search"></p><p>Enter English text describing the desired command and press the return key. For example, entering &quot;delete local git branch&quot; suggests &quot;git branch -d branch_name&quot;. To accept this suggestion, click the &quot;Input Command&quot; button or press cmd-return. Replace any placeholders (such as <code>branch_name</code> above) and press the return key to execute the command.</p><p>Sometimes the suggested commands are correct for Linux and not macOS. To get macOS equivalents, add &quot;on mac&quot; to the English description.</p><p>AI search can also be used to ask questions not related to shell commands. For example, asking &quot;What is a Whippet?&quot; gives the suggestion &quot;A whippet is a small breed of dog with a distinctively tightly curled tail.&quot; Unfortunately this is a bad description.</p><h2 id="workflows" tabindex="-1">Workflows</h2><p>Workflows are named sets of shell commands (typically just one) that are parameterized. They are similar to snippets in code editors.</p><p>Each workflow is defined by a <code>.yaml</code> file.</p><p>To search for a workflow, press ctrl-shift-r.</p><p><img alt="Warp Workflows" style="width: 80%" src="/blog/assets/warp-workflows.png?v=1.1.1" title="Warp Workflows"></p><p>In the popup that appears, select a category in the left nav such as &quot;git&quot;. Then click one of the workflows to copy it to the current block. Replace any placeholders and press the return key to execute the workflow.</p><p>Warp ships with over 100 predefined workflows.</p><p>To install additional workflows, see the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/warpdotdev/workflows?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warpdotdev/workflows</a>.</p><p>To create custom workflows, see <a href="https://docs.warp.dev/features/entry/workflows#creating-custom-workflows?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Creating Custom Workflows</a>.</p><h2 id="selecting-text" tabindex="-1">Selecting Text</h2><p>To select text, perhaps to copy it, drag over it as you would in most editors. Additionally &quot;Smart-Select&quot; allows you to to select a file path, URL, email address, IP address, or floating point number by double-clicking it. To enable or disable this feature, see Settings ... Features ... Terminal ... Double-click smart selection.</p><h2 id="finding-text" tabindex="-1">Finding Text</h2><p>The &quot;Find&quot; and &quot;Find Within Block&quot; commands open a dialog in the upper-right corner of the pane from which they were issued. Search text can be entered here.</p><p><img alt="Warp find dialog" style="width: 80%" src="/blog/assets/warp-find-dialog.png?v=1.1.1" title="Warp find dialog"></p><p>All matches are highlighted in yellow except for the currently selected match is highlighted in orange.</p><p>The total number of matches found and the number of the currently highlighted match are displayed. For example, &quot;2/5&quot; indicates that there a five matches and the second match is the one highlighted in orange.</p><p>In addition, the following buttons are provided:</p><ul><li>navigate to the previous match, cycling to the end after the first is reached</li><li>navigate to the next match, cycling to the beginning after the last is reached</li><li>toggle the use of regular expressions</li><li>toggle whether the search is confined to the block or can search all blocks in the pane</li><li>toggle whether the search is case-sensitive</li><li>close the dialog</li></ul><h2 id="block-bookmarks" tabindex="-1">Block Bookmarks</h2><p>Blocks can be bookmarked to make it easy to find them in the future.</p><p>To toggle whether a block is bookmarked, click its bookmark icon in the upper-right. Alternatively if the block is selected, press cmd-b.</p><p><img alt="Warp Bookmark" style="width: 20%" src="/blog/assets/warp-bookmark.png?v=1.1.1" title="Warp Bookmark"></p><p>The pane scrollbar on the right will contain horizontal lines that indicate the location of each bookmarked block in the pane.</p><p>The color of the bookmark icon and the horizontal lines is based on the selected theme.</p><p>Hovering over one of the horizontal lines displays a popup that contains the working directory of the block, the command that was run, the first two lines of its output, and the number of lines that were omitted.</p><p>To navigate to a bookmarked block, click one of these lines.</p><p>To navigate to the previous bookmarked block, press option-up-arrow.</p><p>To navigate to the new bookmarked block, press option-down-arrow.</p><p>Block bookmarks are not saved across sessions. This may be a bug.</p><h2 id="command-palette" tabindex="-1">Command Palette</h2><p>To quickly find and execute a Warp command (not a shell command), open the command palette by pressing cmd-p, filter the list of commands by typing part of its name, and click a command.</p><p><img alt="Warp Command Palette" style="width: 80%" src="/blog/assets/warp-command-palette.png?v=1.1.1" title="Warp Command Palette"></p><h2 id="themes" tabindex="-1">Themes</h2><p>Warp supports themes that change the look of the user interface. Each theme can define colors, gradients, and a background image and is defined by a <code>.yaml</code> file.</p><p>To choose a theme, open the command palette and select &quot;Open Theme Picker&quot; or press cmd-ctrl-t. This opens a panel on the left that lists all the available themes.</p><p><img alt="Warp Theme Picker" style="width: 50%" src="/blog/assets/warp-theme-picker.png?v=1.1.1" title="Warp Theme Picker"></p><p>The list of themes can be filtered by entering part of a theme name.</p><p>The themes listed appear to be in a somewhat random order. Currently there is no option to sort them by name or separate them into groups of light and dark themes.</p><p>Selecting a theme changes the display to preview the theme.</p><p>To change the theme being used to the selected one, click the checkmark at the bottom. To close the theme picker without changing the theme being used, click the X at the bottom.</p><h2 id="custom-themes" tabindex="-1">Custom Themes</h2><p>The files that define custom themes must be placed in the <code>~/.warp/themes</code> directory. Create this directory if it doesn't exist.</p><p>To download additional open source themes, see the Git repository <a href="https://github.com/warpdotdev/themes?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warpdotdev/themes</a>. This contains several subdirectories such as <code>base16</code>, <code>holiday</code>, <code>standard</code>, and <code>warp_bundled</code> (themes that ship with Warp). Each subdirectory contains a <a href="http://README.md">README.md</a> file that displays previews of each theme defined in the directory.</p><p>To use a theme, download its <code>.yaml</code> file and corresponding background <code>.jpg</code> file, if it has one. For example, to use the &quot;thanksgiving&quot; theme defined in the <code>holiday</code> directory, create a <code>holiday</code> directory in the <code>~/.warp/themes</code> directory and download the files <code>thanksgiving.yaml</code> and <code>thanksgiving_bg.jpg</code> into it. Then open the Theme Picker and select the &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; theme.</p><p>To create a custom theme, create a <code>.yaml</code> file similar to the one shown below. Including a background image is optional. Each theme defines <code>accent</code>, <code>background</code>, and <code>foreground</code> colors. The <code>details</code> property indicates whether it is <code>lighter</code> or <code>darker</code> theme.</p><p>A theme defines two sets of ANSI escape &quot;terminal&quot; colors, one for &quot;bright&quot; and one for &quot;normal&quot;. Each set defines the colors to be used in place of <code>black</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>cyan</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>magenta</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>white</code>, and <code>yellow</code>. The selected colors can differ from these color names. For example, a theme might choose to use a shade of orange for <code>yellow</code>.</p><p>ANSI colors use numbers 0 to 15. Normal colors are 0 to 7 and bright colors are 8 to 15.</p><pre class="language-yaml"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key atrule">background_image</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">path</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> holiday/thanksgiving_bg.jpg<br>  <span class="token key atrule">opacity</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">47</span> <span class="token comment"># 0 to 100</span><br><span class="token key atrule">accent</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#b3deef'</span><br><span class="token key atrule">background</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#282828'</span><br><span class="token key atrule">details</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> darker <span class="token comment"># for dark theme?</span><br><span class="token key atrule">foreground</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#eeeeee'</span><br><span class="token key atrule">terminal_colors</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">normal</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">black</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#282828'</span> <span class="token comment"># 0</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">red</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#f43753'</span> <span class="token comment"># 1</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">green</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#c9d05c'</span> <span class="token comment"># 2</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">yellow</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#ffc24b'</span> <span class="token comment"># 3</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">blue</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#b3deef'</span> <span class="token comment"># 4</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">magenta</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#d3b987'</span> <span class="token comment"># 5</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">cyan</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#73cef4'</span> <span class="token comment"># 6</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">white</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#eeeeee'</span> <span class="token comment"># 7</span><br>  <span class="token key atrule">bright</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">black</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#1d1d1d'</span> <span class="token comment"># 8</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">red</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#dc9656'</span> <span class="token comment"># 9</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">green</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#383838'</span> <span class="token comment"># 10</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">yellow</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#484848'</span> <span class="token comment"># 11</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">blue</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#b8b8b8'</span> <span class="token comment"># 12</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">magenta</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#e8e8e8'</span> <span class="token comment"># 13</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">cyan</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#a16946'</span> <span class="token comment"># 14</span><br>    <span class="token key atrule">white</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'#ffffff'</span> <span class="token comment"># 15</span></code></pre><p>For more detail see <a href="https://docs.warp.dev/appearance/custom-themes?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Custom Themes</a>.</p><h2 id="permalinks-%2F-shared-blocks" tabindex="-1">Permalinks / Shared Blocks</h2><p>Creating a permalink for a block provides a URL that can be shared with others to view the shell command and output associated with the block.</p><p>There are multiple ways to initiate create a permalink:</p><ul><li>Open the command palette and select the &quot;Share Selected Block&quot;

Clicking it displays a tooltip containing a button labelled &quot;Open File&quot; or &quot;Open Directory&quot; that can be clicked to open the file or open the directory in a Finder window.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Show warning before quitting&quot; (on by default)</p><p>When this option is on and an attempt is made to quit Warp while there are processes running, a dialog will appear allowing you to verify that you really want to quit which will kill the processes.

Multi-line prompts are not currently supported.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Keys section</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Hotkey Window&quot; (off by default)</p><p>When this option is on and a keyboard shortcut is assigned, pressing the keyboard shortcut when in any application brings Warp to the front and makes it the active application. This can configure the monitor on which is should appear, the size of the screen to which it should be pinned, the size of the Warp window. I use cmd-shift-w for the keyboard shortcut.</p></li></ul><p>None of the remaining options here are particularly interesting and the default settings seem fine.</p></li><li><p>Editor section</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Open completions menu as you type&quot; (off by default)</p><p>When this option is on, a completions menu is display while typing commands.
