It is a purely object-oriented programming language. Everything is represented by an object that is an instance of some class. This includes classes themselves and all the GUI elements in the development environment. Everything happens by sending messages to objects. The objects decide whether and how to act on the messages.</p><p>Smalltalk was the first programming language to make OOP popular. In the 1990's the popularity of Smalltalk had risen enough that it was seen as an alternative to C++. In 1995 Smalltalk had a 15% market share compared to 71% for C++.</p><p>The characteristic of Smalltalk that first attracted me to it is its simple, minimal syntax. Its entire syntax of Smalltalk can be demonstrated on a post card.</p><p><img alt="Smalltalk on a post card" src="/blog/assets/smalltalk-on-postcard.jpg?v=1.1.1"></p><p>Smalltalk is a dynamically typed language. Types of variables, method parameters, and method return types are never specified. Instead, duck typing is used. Any object can be used as long as it is able to respond to all the messages that are sent to it. This is determined at run-time.</p><p>Running Smalltalk programs requires two parts, a virtual machine (VM) and an image file. The VM reads and executes Smalltalk code found in an image file. It is specific to the operating system and CPU architecture being used.</p><p>Image files can be moved between operating systems on different CPU architectures. It will render the same windows, pixel for pixel, across Windows, Linux, and MacOS, only differing based on screen size. There is no need to recompile code for different environments. This makes Smalltalk code highly portable!</p><p>An image file can be thought of as a snapshot of the current state of the development environment. It describes a collection of all the active objects. During development, changes can be saved to the current image or to a new image.</p><p>Today Smalltalk is still used by the financial industry, manufacturing, utilities, transportation, and academia.</p><h2 id="a-bit-of-history" tabindex="-1">A Bit of history</h2><p>Squeak Smalltalk, released in 1996, was the first free, open-source implementation. Until then all Smalltalk implementations were commericial and were expensive. The Java programming language was released in 1995 and was free. That removed most of the wind from Smalltalk sails and for most part it receded into the history of computer programming.</p><p>However, Smalltalk is alive and well outside the United States. Two free, open-source forks of Squeak have been created.</p><p>Pharo Smalltalk was created in France and aims to provide a more comprehensive set of features.</p><p>Cuis Smalltalk was created in Argentina and aims to remain small and easy to learn. Missing features can be defined by combining the features that are present and by installing more packages.</p><p>Squeak, Pharo, and Cuis all use the MIT license.</p><p>There are also many commercial Smalltalk implementations including Cincom Smalltalk, GemStone/S, and VA Smalltalk.</p><p>The Cuis mascot is southern mountain cavy found in Argentina which is a tailless rodent that looks similar to a very large mouse. The word &quot;cuis&quot; in Rioplatense Spanish means &quot;squeak&quot;.</p><h2 id="smalltalk-development-environment" tabindex="-1">Smalltalk development environment</h2><p>Smalltalk is perhaps most known for its incredible development tools. These support:</p><ul><li>finding code in many ways</li><li>a live environment where code changes are immediately reflected (no need to recompile or restart the environment)</li><li>debugging with the ability to modify code and data, then continue or restart</li><li>ability to modify the classes and methods that implement the development environment as easily as modifying your own classes and methods</li><li>inspecting objects to see their class and instance variables</li><li>rapid prototyping</li></ul><h2 id="why-learn-smalltalk-now%3F" tabindex="-1">Why learn Smalltalk now?</h2><p>Learning Smalltalk will enable you to:</p><ul><li>Gain an understanding of its pros and cons compared to other languages.</li><li>Get ideas for features that can be added to other languages.</li><li>Get ideas for features that can be added in the development environments of other languages.</li><li>Actually use it as an alternative to other languages.</li></ul><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk" target="_blank">Smalltalk in Wikipedia</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08" target="_blank">Byte Magazine issue on Smalltalk</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://cuis.st" target="_blank">Cuis Smalltalk</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://pharo.org" target="_blank">Pharo Smalltalk</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://squeak.org" target="_blank">Squeak Smalltalk</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6601A198DF14788D" target="_blank">Squeak from the very start</a> YouTube videos by Lawson English</p></li></ul><p>The following recent podcast episodes discuss Smalltalk:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sokb6zZC-ZE&t=3105s" target="_blank">Cuis Smalltalk and the History of Computing’s Future</a> with Juan Vuletich</li><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-unscripted/id1602572955?i=1000656742775" target="_blank">A Haskller Tries Smalltalk</a> with Ian Jeffries</li><li><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-unscripted/id1602572955" target="_blank">Smalltalk's Past, Present, and Future</a> with Juan Vuletich</li></ul></article>
