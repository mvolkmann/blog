The macOS version is included with Xcode and cannot be downloaded separately.</p><p>The app can import virtual objects from existing 3D models, add animations to them, and add audio that can be triggered in many ways. The app can also &quot;record sensor and camera data in the actual location you are building it for, and then replay it on your iOS device&quot;.</p><p>Non-Apple alternatives to Reality Composer include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.blender.org?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blender</a></li><li><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Maya</a></li><li><a href="https://unity.com?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unity</a></li><li><a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a></li></ul><p>To launch the &quot;Reality Composer&quot; app in macOS, launch Xcode and select Xcode ...

For example, this can be an action in a &quot;Tap&quot; behavior so tapping an object triggers a scene change.

To ungroup the objects in a group, tap the group to selected it, tap again to get a popup of options, and tap &quot;Ungroup&quot;.</p><h2 id="physics" tabindex="-1">Physics</h2><p>Objects can optionally participate in physics. When participating objects are off the ground and their scene is played, gravity causes them to fall toward the ground.</p><p>To cause an object to participate in physics:</p><ul><li>Tap the object to select it.</li><li>In the Inspector on the right, expand the &quot;Physics&quot; section.</li><li>Change the &quot;Participates&quot; toggle to be on.</li><li>Select a &quot;Motion Type&quot; of either &quot;Fixed&quot; (never moves) or &quot;Dynamic&quot; (can move).</li><li>Select a &quot;Material&quot; which can be &quot;Lead&quot;, &quot;Plastic&quot;, &quot;Wood&quot;, or &quot;Rubber&quot;.
