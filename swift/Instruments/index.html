Profile</li><li>Select Xcode ... Open Developer Tool ... Instruments.</li></ul><p>The Instruments app will open a dialog for choosing at profiling template. A commonly used profiling template is &quot;SwiftUI&quot;, but there are over 20 templates to try including &quot;Core Data&quot;, &quot;Leaks&quot;, &quot;Logging&quot;, &quot;Network&quot; (ex. HTTP traffic), and &quot;Swift Concurrency&quot;.</p><h2 id="swiftui-profiling" tabindex="-1">SwiftUI Profiling</h2><p>Select the &quot;SwiftUI&quot; category and click the &quot;Choose&quot; button. A new window will open where profiling data will be displayed.</p><p>Click the record button in the upper-left to launch the app (in release mode) and begin analyzing its performance. Exercise the app in the Simulator to trigger the functionality to be analyzed.</p><p>Click the pause or stop buttons in the upper-left to stop execution so the results so far can be examined. Select a category row in the top half to see detail on that category displayed in the bottom half. Categories include:</p><ul><li><p>View Body</p><p>This category measures the number and duration of view body evaluations divided into provided SwiftUI views and custom views.</p></li><li><p>View Properties</p><p>This category shows the current and previous values of all view properties. Unfortunately it does not show the names of the properties. I wasn't able to get this category to show ANY data!</p></li><li><p>Core Animation Commit</p><p>This category shows the number and duration of Core Animation transaction commits.</p></li><li><p>Time Profiler</p><p>This category shows time spent in each part of the code.</p></li></ul><p>The bottom half displays a table of statistics for the selected category. The columns &quot;Count&quot; and &quot;Average Duration&quot; are particularly interesting. For example, when the &quot;View Body&quot; category is selected, we can see how many times a <code>Button</code> view was evaluated and the average number of milliseconds or microseconds required each time.</p><p>For the &quot;View Body&quot; category, the &quot;Timing Summary&quot; in the bottom half of the window divides the data into two categories, the app and SwiftUI. Expand those sections to get detail on each. The views in each section are sorted by their &quot;Count&quot; from largest to smallest.</p><h2 id="timelines" tabindex="-1">Timelines</h2><p>To zoom in and out on the bars in the top half of the window, press cmd-plus and cmd-minus.</p><p>To see data summarized over a particular time interval of the run, identify the time interval of interest by dragging across any bar in the top half of the window.</p></article>
