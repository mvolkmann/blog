Hypermedia is any data format that can describe branching from one &quot;media&quot; (ex. a document) to another. A hypermedia control is an element that describes a server interaction such as anchor (<code>a</code>) and <code>form</code> elements in HTML.</p><p>Htmx adds support for new HTML attributes that make HTML more expressive. These attributes enable implementing &quot;Hypermedia-Driven Applications&quot; (HDAs).</p><p>The new HTML attributes enable responding to any kind of interaction (ex. click) with any HTML element by sending an HTTP request using any method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE). The response must contain HTML. Rather than performing a complete page refresh, the returned HTML replaces an existing DOM element (transclusion) or is inserted relative to one.</p><p>Htmx removes the need to serialize data to JSON on the server, parse the JSON on the client, and build an HTML representation from the data.</p><p><img alt="hypermedia driven applications" style="border: none; width: 70%" src="/blog/assets/hypermedia-driven-applications.png?v=1.1.1"></p><p>The server can be implemented using any programming language and server framework. This is referred to as &quot;Hypermedia On Whatever you'd Like&quot; (HOWL). The server typically plays two roles. First, it serves static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Second, it responds to HTTP requests by returning HTML.</p><p>Many web app features typically thought to require custom JavaScript code can instead be implemented with only htmx. Examples include lazy loading of data, infinite scrolling, and searching while the user types in an <code>input</code>.</p><p>The fact that all HTML rendered by htmx applications is either static or server-rendered makes it great for SEO.</p><p>Users perceive apps built with htmx to be fast because the initial page load only requires the htmx library (&lt; 17K) and the initial HTML to render. Subsequent interactions only require fetching snippets of HTML. No client-side hydration of JavaScript code is needed. Browsers are very efficient at updating the DOM from strings of HTML.</p><p>The htmx library is implemented in JavaScript, not TypeScript, in a single source file. There are plans to add JSDoc TypeScript type definitions for better code editor support.</p><h2 id="why-use-htmx%3F" tabindex="-1">Why Use htmx?</h2><p>The following is a brief summary of the main benefits of using htmx compared to SPA frameworks. Many of these are discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.</p><ul><li><p>Fixes HTML shortcomings</p><p>Htmx enables many kinds of user interactions with any kind of HTML element to trigger any kind of HTTP request and insert HTML in the response into a specific location in the DOM without a full page refresh. This dramatically reduces the need for custom client-side JavaScript code. It also preserves scroll state.</p></li><li><p>Improves startup time</p><p>With htmx browsers download considerably less JavaScript code which improves metrics such as &quot;First Contentful Paint&quot; and &quot;Time to Interactive&quot;. This results in a better user experience.</p></li><li><p>Favors LoB over SoC</p><p>The Locality of Behavior (LoB) pattern places related code together which makes the code easier to understand and modify than following a Separation of Concerns (SoC) pattern. From Richard Gabriel, LoB &quot;enables a programmer to understand source by looking at only a small portion of it.&quot;</p></li><li><p>Eliminates JSON as an intermediate format</p><p>Typically SPA application endpoints fetch data, serialize it to JSON, and return the JSON. Then code running in the browser parses the JSON and generates HTML from it.</p><p>Htmx endpoints fetch data, generate HTML from it, and return the HTML. The browser only has to render the returned HTML. Removing JSON as an intermediate format provides efficiency gains.</p></li><li><p>Enables Hypermedia ON Whatever you'd Like (HOWL)</p><p>Htmx enables implementing web applications using any programming language that can implement an HTTP server whose endpoints return HTML responses. This includes most programming languages.</p></li><li><p>Encourages full-stack development</p><p>Often in SPA development one team of developers implements endpoints that return JSON data and another team of developers implements web user interfaces that use those endpoints.</p><p>With htmx each developer develops complete features by implementing endpoints that return HTML that includes htmx attributes. This requires developers to know the selected programming language, HTML, and CSS, but not necessarily JavaScript.</p></li><li><p>Reduces learning curve</p><p>Learning how to use htmx attributes in HTML is significantly easier than learning a SPA framework.</p></li><li><p>Simplifies state management</p><p>Typical SPA applications manage state on both the server and client. Keeping the state in sync in two places introduces challenges.</p><p>With htmx all the state is only on the server, so no state synchronization is needed and browser memory usage is reduced.</p></li><li><p>Simplifies client-side code</p><p>See the next section for details.</p></li></ul><h2 id="simplified-client-side" tabindex="-1">Simplified Client-side</h2><p>Using endpoints that return HTML instead of JSON removes the need for many things including:</p><ul><li><p>nearly all client-side logic</p><p>This is mostly unnecessary because the logic is embedded in the HTML elements returned by the server. This implements Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS).</p><p>Fewer client-side dependencies are needed and client-side build time is reduced.</p></li><li><p>managing client-side data models</p><p>This is unnecessary because all the data remains only on the server.</p></li><li><p>client-side routing</p><p>This is unnecessary because page updates and transitions are handled by HTTP requests triggered on elements described in the HTML returned by the server.</p></li><li><p>versioning</p><p>This is unnecessary because the browser does not need to interpret the meaning of the HTML being returned. All that is needed is a URL for rendering a starting page for an application. All other interactions are derived through URLs in that page and pages reached from it. Endpoints are free to modify the HTML they return. This is the crux of HATEOAS (described later)</p></li></ul><p>The HTML returned by endpoints is typically larger than a corresponding JSON response would be. This is a non-issue because htmx trades &quot;representational efficiency&quot; for achieving other goals such as the ones described above.</p><h2 id="history-and-future" tabindex="-1">History and Future</h2><p>Htmx was created by <a href="https://bigsky.software/cv/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Carson Gross</a>. He is a principal software engineer at <a href="https://bigsky.software/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Big Sky Software</a> and a part-time Computer Science instructor at Montana State University.</p><p>Carson been working on the approach of simplifying web development by adding attributes to HTML for a long time.</p><p>The predecessor of htmx, also created by Carson Gross, is <a href="https://intercoolerjs.org?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">intercooler.js</a>. Work on intercooler.js began in 2013 and the first version was released in April 2014. Intercooler had a dependency on jQuery, but htmx does not.</p><p>The first version of htmx was released in May 2020. The 1.0 version was released in November, 2020. The latest version as of December 2023 is 1.9.10 which is less than 17K.</p><p>Htmx has an extensive set of integration tests implemented in Mocha.</p><p>Interest in htmx exploded in 2023 after YouTube videos from ThePrimeagen and Fireship were released. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHHIqI9lUY?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">htmx</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-GSGH2RxJs?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">htmx in 100 seconds</a>.</p><p>Htmx had a strong showing in the 2023 JavaScript Rising Stars results. See <a href="https://risingstars.js.org/2023/en#section-framework?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Front-end Frameworks</a>.</p><p>Htmx 2.0 is expected in early 2024. It will remove legacy support for things like IE, old style WebSockets, and old style server sent events. There will also be some changes to default behavior such as not enabling CORS by default. Other changes are not expected to be dramatic.</p><p>Carson Gross wishes that the functionality of htmx would be folded into HTML, making htmx unnecessary.</p><p>Companies that sponsor the development of htmx are listed on the <a href="https://htmx.org?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">htmx home page</a>. They include GitHub and JetBrains.</p><h2 id="rest" tabindex="-1">REST</h2><p>Web app frameworks such as React, Svelte, Angular, and Vue have popularized the creation of single-page applications (SPAs). SPA web apps typically use client-side JavaScript code to send HTTP requests to server-side endpoints that query/update databases, serialize the data into JSON, and return it. The browser parses the JSON into a JavaScript object and client code updates the page with HTML that is generated from that object. Client-side code is responsible for understanding the meaning of JSON data and breaks if the endpoints change to return different data. Many developers refer to this architecture as &quot;REST&quot;.</p><p>This is not what Roy Fielding had in mind when he wrote his famous dissertation &quot;<a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>&quot; that gave birth to REST. Roy has been <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quoted</a> saying &quot;I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based interface a REST API. ... That is RPC.&quot;</p><p>This does not mean that architectures commonly referred to as REST are bad. They just do not fit the Fielding definition of REST.</p><p>A software architecture is RESTful if it:</p><ul><li>uses a client/server model</li><li>is stateless</li><li>caches responses</li><li>supports a uniform interface</li></ul><p>A uniform interface is one where:</p><ul><li>requests identify a resource</li><li>resources are manipulated through representations</li><li>messages are self-descriptive</li><li>HATEOAS is used (described next)</li></ul><h2 id="hateoas" tabindex="-1">HATEOAS</h2><p>&quot;Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State&quot; (<a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hateoas/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HATEOAS</a>) is a specific use of the REST architecture where services return hypermedia. The acronym HATEOAS does not appear in the dissertation, but its concepts are discussed.</p><p>Carson Gross describes HATEOAS systems as follows: &quot;Given an entry point into the system, the rest of the system can be accessed simply by inspecting the hypermedia.&quot;</p><p>HTML is a kind of hypermedia and web browsers are hypermedia clients. Responses to requests can contain HTML. Browsers render the HTML which enables users to view and operate on resources.</p><p>Such responses are similar to object-oriented programming where objects contain data and methods for operating on their data. Browsers simply render the HTML returned. They do not require any resource-specific knowledge about how to render or interact with resources.</p><p>JSON is not hypermedia. JSON responses do not support HATEOAS because they typically only contain raw data with no information on how to interact with it. In addition, browsers do not know how to render JSON data. Client code is required to understand the meaning of the data in order to render it in a human-readable way.</p><h2 id="html-issues" tabindex="-1">HTML Issues</h2><p>Htmx addresses four important shortcomings of HTML.</p><ol><li><p>Which elements can trigger sending an HTTP request?</p><p>The only HTML elements that send an HTTP request are <code>a</code> (anchor) and <code>form</code> When an anchor is clicked, it sends a GET requests to a specified URL. When a <code>form</code> is submitted, it sends a GET or POST request to a specified URL. For GET requests, form data is attached to the URL in query parameters. For POST requests, form data is included in the request body.</p><p>Htmx enables any element to send an HTTP request.</p></li><li><p>What events trigger sending an HTTP request?</p><p>In HTML, clicking an anchor or submitting a <code>form</code> are the only events that trigger sending an HTTP request.</p><p>Htmx enables any DOM event, and custom events, to trigger sending an HTTP request.</p></li><li><p>What kinds of HTTP requests can be sent?</p><p>HTML only sends GET and POST requests.</p><p>Htmx enables sending any kind of HTTP request which includes PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.</p></li><li><p>How is the response rendered?</p><p>When HTML sends an HTTP request, the entire page is replaced by the response.</p><p>Htmx enables replacing specific elements with the response (transclusion) or inserting the response relative to an existing element, while leaving the rest of the page intact.</p></li></ol><h2 id="questions-to-consider" tabindex="-1">Questions to Consider</h2><p>What is the benefit of serializing data to JSON on the server, returning JSON to the browser, parsing JSON in the browser, and using client-side code to convert the data into HTML? With htmx the steps of serializing data to JSON on the server and parsing JSON in the browser are eliminated.</p><p>What are the advantages of generating HTML in the browser instead of doing the same work on the server?</p><p>Why should we restrict ourselves to only using JavaScript to implement web applications? With htmx the server code can be implemented in any programming language that supports implementing HTTP servers. The most suitable languages are ones that provide good support for HTML templating. It is also desirable to have editor tooling that provides syntax highlighting of HTML and checking for proper HTML including attribute usage and element nesting.</p><h2 id="use-cases" tabindex="-1">Use Cases</h2><p>Htmx is great for CRUD-based applications and dashboards. But htmx is not appropriate for all web app features.</p><p>Using htmx to update the UI on every mouse move or drag would be too slow since each movement would trigger a new HTTP request. Examples of apps that require this kind of functionality include Google Maps and many games.</p><p>Htmx is not appropriate for spreadsheet-like UIs where a change in one part of the UI triggers changes in many other parts that need to be reflected quickly.</p><p>Htmx cannot currently be used in apps that require offline support because they rely on sending HTTP requests to get new HTML that updates the UI. However, there is a effort to address this. See <a href="https://github.com/spirodonfl/htmx-offline-mode?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">htmx-offline-mode</a>.</p><p>Htmx can be used in conjunction with other approaches. Consider using it for all the parts of apps that do not require high frequency updates.</p><h2 id="choosing-a-stack" tabindex="-1">Choosing a Stack</h2><p>The server side of htmx web apps can be implemented with any programming language and HTTP server library. Of course some options are better than others.</p><p>Good choices have tooling that supports the following:</p><ul><li>Fast, automatic hot reloading after source code changes.</li><li>Syntax highlighting in code editors.</li><li>Good HTML templating support such as JSX, not relying on string concatenation.</li><li>Knowledge of HTML rules in code editors so errors are flagged while writing code.</li></ul><p>Good choices make it easy to do the following:</p><ul><li><p>Create new endpoints for any HTTP verb.</p><p>One of the primary activities when using htmx is defining endpoints. It's best when an endpoint can be described in a single source file, rather than requiring editing multiple files.</p></li><li><p>Specify type checking or request data including values of request headers, path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies that can contain text, form data, JSON.</p></li><li><p>Get request data in the form of request headers, path parameters, query parameters, and request bodies that can contain text, form data, JSON.</p></li><li><p>Send responses in the form of response headers and response bodies that can contain text and HTML.</p></li></ul><h2 id="browser-reload-in-development" tabindex="-1">Browser Reload in Development</h2><p>Many tech stacks support automatically restarting servers when code changes are saved, but they often do not reload browser windows that render the HTML that they serve.

The first thing to consider is what will trigger a request to be sent.</p><p>HTML elements such as <code>input</code>, <code>textarea</code>, and <code>select</code> automatically trigger when they emit a &quot;change&quot; event. HTML <code>form</code> elements automatically trigger when they emit a <code>submit</code> event. The default trigger for all other elements is &quot;click&quot;.</p><p>To trigger on different events, add the <code>hx-trigger</code> attribute. The value of this attribute can be a single event, a comma-separated list of events, or <code>every {timing}</code> to trigger repeatedly at a given time interval (for polling).</p><p>DOM event names include <code>blur</code>, <code>change</code>, <code>click</code>, <code>contextmenu</code>, <code>dblclick</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>hashchange</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>keydown</code>, <code>keypress</code>, <code>keyup</code>, <code>load</code>, <code>mousedown</code>, <code>mouseenter</code>, <code>mouseleave</code>, <code>mousemove</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseup</code>, <code>resize</code>, <code>scroll</code>, <code>submit</code>, <code>touchcancel</code>, <code>touchend</code>, <code>touchmove</code>, <code>touchstart</code>, <code>unload</code>, and more. Custom event names can also be used.</p><p>A space-separated list of event modifiers can follow an event name. Supported event modifiers include:</p><ul><li><code>changed</code> - only send request if the element value has changed</li><li><code>consume</code> - stops the event from bubbling up to ancestor elements</li><li><code>delay:{time}</code> - wait at least this long before each request is sent (debouncing)</li><li><code>from:{css-selector}</code> - listen for the event on a different element</li><li><code>once</code> - only trigger the request one time</li><li><code>queue</code> - affects how concurrent events are processed</li><li><code>target</code> - only trigger if event occurred on an element matching a CSS selector</li><li><code>throttle:{time}</code> - only send the last event received in the specified time and then wait again</li></ul><p>For example, the following trigger is useful for implementing active search.</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:500ms"</code></pre><p>The &quot;changed&quot; modifier causes the HTTP request to only be sent if the value of the input has changed. For example, using the arrow keys to move the cursor does not change the value.</p><p>The &quot;delay&quot; modifier adds debouncing so an HTTP request is only sent when the user briefly stops typing, not for every change.</p><p>Events can be filtered so they only trigger in specific circumstances. This is specified in square brackets after an event name. For example, <code>click[shiftKey]</code> only triggers when an element is clicked while the shift key is held down. Multiple filters can be specify by and'ing them. For example, <code>click[shiftKey &amp;&amp; ctrlKey]</code>. The square brackets can also contain a call to a JavaScript function that returns a Boolean value where triggering doesn't occur if the function returns <code>false</code>.</p><h2 id="requests" tabindex="-1">Requests</h2><p>Interacting with any HTML element can trigger an HTTP request.</p><p>The following attributes all specify the URL to which a specific kind of HTTP request should be sent when the user triggers the element: <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-get/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-get</a>, <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-post/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-post</a>, <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-put/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-put</a>, <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-patch/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-patch</a>, and <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-delete/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-delete</a>.</p><p>When an HTTP request is triggered on a <code>form</code> element, the values of all inputs inside the form will be included in the request. When a non-GET HTTP request is triggered on a non-form element, htmx will search upward in the DOM hierarchy for a <code>form</code> element. If one is found, htmx will include the values of all inputs inside the form in the request. If a form is not found, only the value of the element that triggered the request is included.</p><p>To include the values of additional form elements that are outside the <code>form</code> (or when no <code>form</code> is used), add the <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-include/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-include</a> attribute. Its value is a comma-separated list of CSS selectors, include the relative values described in the &quot;Targets&quot; section.</p><p>See the working example project that uses <code>hx-include</code> at <a href="https://github.com/mvolkmann/htmx-examples/tree/main/non-form-submit?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">non-form-submit</a>.</p><p>To omit the values of some of the form elements that are inside the form, add the <code>hx-params</code> attribute. For more detail, see <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-params/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-params</a>.</p><p>The <code>hx-confirm</code> attribute specifies a question to display in a browser-supplied confirmation dialog (using the <code>Window</code> method <code>confirm</code>) before an HTTP request is sent. The dialog contain have &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons. The request will only be sent if the user clicks the &quot;OK&quot; button.</p><p>The <code>hx-prompt</code> attribute specifies a prompt to display in a browser-supplied prompt dialog (using the <code>Window</code> method <code>prompt</code>) before an HTTP request is sent. The dialog contain a text input and &quot;OK&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; buttons. The request will only be sent if the user clicks the &quot;OK&quot; button. The request header <code>HX-Prompt</code> will hold the value the user entered in the text input.</p><p>The confirmation dialog is very plain and cannot be styled. It may be preferable to use a dialog that can be styled, perhaps using the HTML <code>dialog</code> element.</p><p>The <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-sync/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-sync</a> attribute coordinates concurrent requests. For example, entering data in an <code>input</code> that is inside a <code>form</code> could trigger two requests, one to validate the <code>input</code> value and one to submit the <code>form</code>. By default, these requests will run in parallel. If <code>hx-sync=&quot;closest form:abort</code> is applied to the <code>input</code>, the validation request will be sent first. If the validation succeeds then the submit request will be sent. Otherwise it will be aborted.</p><h2 id="urls" tabindex="-1">URLs</h2><p>Htmx endpoints return HTML, not JSON. Their URLs are based on user interface functionality, not resource paths. For example, <code>/todos/:id/toggle</code> is a reasonable URL path for an endpoint that toggles the completed status of todo and returns HTML for the updated todo item.</p><h2 id="security" tabindex="-1">Security</h2><p>Three ways to increase the security of an htmx application are:</p><ul><li>Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) which limits the sources of assets.</li><li>Configure htmx to ignore script tags in HTML returned by endpoints. This is described in the <a href="#configuring">Configuring</a> section.</li><li>Prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing the HTML returned from endpoints if it includes user-entered content.</li></ul><p>All three of these options can prevent executing <code>script</code> tags found in user-entered text.</p><h3 id="content-security-policy-(csp)" tabindex="-1">Content Security Policy (CSP)</h3><p>A CSP is specified by adding a <code>meta</code> tag as a child of the <code>head</code> tag in each HTML page. For example:</p><pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>meta</span><br>  <span class="token attr-name">http-equiv</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>Content-Security-Policy<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><br>  <span class="token attr-name">content</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">"</span>default-src 'self'; img-src https://*<span class="token punctuation">"</span></span><br><span class="token punctuation">/></span></span></code></pre><p>This CSP says:</p><ul><li>By default all content must come from the domain of this web app.</li><li>An exception is made for images which can come from any <code>https</code> URL.</li></ul><p>With this CSP in place, all JavaScript libraries including htmx will need to be downloaded and served from the web app domain.</p><p>For more detail on what can be specified in a CSP, see the MDN <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Content-Security-Policy</a> page.</p><h3 id="sanitizing-html" tabindex="-1">Sanitizing HTML</h3><p>A good library for sanitizing HTML is <a href="https://github.com/apostrophecms/sanitize-html?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sanitize-html</a>.

When using JSX, we can avoid cluttering the <code>form</code> element by using attribute spreading. Another reason to use this is because VS Code does not recognize <code>hx-on:htmx:after-request</code> as a valid attribute name.</p><pre class="language-js"><code class="language-js"><span class="token keyword">const</span> reset <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><br>  <span class="token string-property property">'hx-on:htmx:after-request'</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token template-string"><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span><span class="token string"><br>    if (event.detail.pathInfo.requestPath === '/account' &amp;&amp;<br>      event.detail.successful) this.reset()</span><span class="token template-punctuation string">`</span></span><br><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><br><br><span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><br>  <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">></span><br>    <span class="token operator">...</span><br>    <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>form hx<span class="token operator">-</span>post<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"/account"</span> hx<span class="token operator">-</span>target<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"#result"</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token operator">...</span>reset<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token operator">></span><br>      <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token comment">/* Add form inputs here.<br>          HTML form validation will not work<br>          if the hx-post attribute is moved<br>          from the form to this button. */</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><br>      <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>button<span class="token operator">></span>Submit<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>button<span class="token operator">></span><br>    <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>form<span class="token operator">></span><br>    <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>div id<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"result"</span> <span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token operator">></span><br>    <span class="token operator">...</span><br>  <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token operator">></span><br><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></code></pre><h3 id="active-search" tabindex="-1">Active Search</h3><p>Htmx can be used to implement an active search where a list of matching data is retrieved as the user enters search text.

add a specific HTTP header to all requests send by htmx. For example, an authentication token can be passed in a header named &quot;X-Token&quot;.

Parameters can also be removed or modified, but that seems less useful. The values of <code>event.detail.target</code> and <code>event.detail.verb</code> can also be modified, but both seem like odd things to do.</p><p>See the working example at <a href="https://github.com/mvolkmann/htmx-examples/tree/main/token-header?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">token-header</a>.</p><h2 id="http-request-headers" tabindex="-1">HTTP Request Headers</h2><p>HTTP header names are case-insensitive.</p><p>Htmx automatically adds following request headers to all HTTP requests it sends if they are applicable.

For example, if your server renders the full HTML when the <code>HX-Request</code> header is missing or <code>false</code>, and it renders a fragment of that HTML when <code>HX-Request: true</code>, you need to add <code>Vary: HX-Request</code>.

For example, we can't define a &quot;ProgressBar&quot; component and then render it with HTML like <code>&lt;ProgressBar value={value} max={100} /&gt;</code>.</p><p>One solution is to use <a href="/blog/bun" target="_blank">Components</a> which has builtin support for JSX. This enables writing JavaScript functions that act like React components (minus support for hooks and DOM diffing), taking props and returning JSX. Bun can be combined with a server framework like <a href="https://elysiajs.com?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Elysia</a>.</p><p>For a potential solution, see <a href="/blog/alpine#components" target="_blank">Components</a>.</p><h2 id="events" tabindex="-1">Events</h2><p>The <a href="https://htmx.org/docs/#hx-on?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-on</a> attribute supports handling of more types of events than the HTML <code>on*</code> attributes such as <code>onclick</code>. It provides a small subset of the capabilities in <a href="https://alpinejs.dev?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alpine</a> and <a href="https://hyperscript.org?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">_hyperscript</a> which can be used in place of this attribute.</p><h2 id="validation" tabindex="-1">Validation</h2><p>TODO: Try this. The <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-validate/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-validate</a> attribute causes an element to validate itself using the HTML5 Validation API before a request is sent. This occurs by default for <code>form</code> elements, but not for <code>input</code>, <code>textarea</code>, and <code>select</code>elements. When those elements have <code>hx-\*</code> attributes that send an HTTP request, adding <code>hx-validate=&quot;true&quot;</code> causes them to be validated before the request is sent.</p><h2 id="boosting" tabindex="-1">Boosting</h2><p>Anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) and <code>form</code> elements that do not have attributes like <code>hx-get</code> or <code>hx-post</code> send HTTP requests to a given URL even when JavaScript is disabled. When an anchor is clicked, a GET request is sent. When a <code>form</code> is submitted, a GET or POST request (depending on the <code>method</code> attribute value) is sent.</p><p>The <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-boost/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-boost</a> attribute can be added to any element. This changes descendant anchor and <code>form</code> elements that do not have attributes like <code>hx-get</code> or <code>hx-post</code> to use AJAX for sending the HTTP request, but only if JavaScript is enabled. For example, <code>hx-boost=&quot;true&quot;</code> can be added to the <code>body</code> element to &quot;boost&quot; all anchor and <code>form</code> elements.</p><p>The advantage boosting is that less processing will be done. Rather than a full page refresh, the body content in the response will replace the body content of the current page and the <code>title</code> in the <code>head</code> tag will replace that in the current <code>head</code>. This avoids processing <code>link</code> and <code>script</code> tags in the <code>head</code> tag of the response which provides a significant performance advantage. Of course this assumes that the current page has already loaded all the CSS and JavaScript that is needed by the new content. The result is faster navigation and a better user experience.</p><p>To disable boosting of specific anchors and forms that are descendants of an element with <code>hx-boost=&quot;true&quot;</code>, add <code>hx-boost=&quot;false&quot;</code> to them.</p><p>Note that many features of htmx will not work if JavaScript is disable.</p><h2 id="other" tabindex="-1">Other</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-disinherit/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-disinherit</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-encoding/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-encoding</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-vals/?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hx-vals</a></p><p>This specifies additional, static data to be passed in HTTP requests.
