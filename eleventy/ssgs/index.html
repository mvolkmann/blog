This means there is less of a chance that server hacking can affect the content of a site.</li><li>The supported markup/templating options are typically easier to write and understand than HTML.</li><li>Development of an SSG site can start from a pre-built site to speed development.</li></ul><p>See <a href="https://www.staticgen.com?v=1.1.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">staticgen.com</a> for a list of SSGs that can be sorted on various criteria.</p><p>Key differentiators between SSGs include:</p><ul><li>supported template languages (Angular, EJS, Go, Haml, Handlebars, HTML, JavaScript, Liquid, Markdown, Marko, Mustache, Nunjucks, Pug, React, Swig, Twig, Vue, ...)</li><li>the implementation language (Go, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, ...) which affects your ability to customize the software</li><li>ability to configure the SSG to use existing content files and directory structures</li><li>license (Apache-2.0, Jinja2, MIT, ...)</li></ul><p>For static sites that obtain data from API services, a common strategy is to automatically regenerate them on a scheduled basis such as every night. This is not typically difficult to implement.</p><p>Another strategy is to store all the files for a site in a repository such as GitHub and automatically rebuild and redeploy the site any time changes are pushed.</p></article>
