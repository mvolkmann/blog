style="width: 80%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-home-stack.jpg?v=1.1.1"></p><h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1">Overview</h2><p>HyperCard is a Macintosh application for viewing and creating multimedia applications built with HyperCard stacks which are collections of cards. Actions can be scripted using the built-in HyperTalk language or AppleScript. This includes interacting with other applications and exchanging data with documents from other applications.</p><p>The original application name was WildCard. It was changed to HyperCard shortly before the initial release because the name WildCard was already trademarked.</p><p>HyperCard initially released in August, 1987. The last version of HyperCard, released in 1988, was 2.4.1. The oldest version of Mac OS that can run some version of HyperCard is Mac OS 6.0.5. The newest version of Mac OS that can run HyperCard is 9.2.2.</p><p>HyperCard was developed at Apple by Bill Atkinson and Dan Winkler, using Apple Pascal.</p><p>Bill Atkinson said of HyperCard that &quot;It's programming for the rest of us.&quot; HyperCard allows non-developers to create applications that can easily be shared with others.</p><p>For a time, HyperCard came preinstalled on all Macintosh computers.</p><p>The original version of the game Myst was developed in HyperCard.</p><p>The first card in the default HyperCard Home stack contains buttons that navigate to commonly used stacks. Click the &quot;HyperCard Tour&quot; stack for a good overview of the application. At any point, press cmd-h to return to the Home stack.</p><p>Changes to stacks are saved automatically. There is no save button or menu item.</p><h2 id="launching-hypercard" tabindex="-1">Launching HyperCard</h2><p>To launch HyperCard, double click on the app icon or on the icon of a HyperCard stack. If the app icon was double clicked, the Home stack will be opened. The first card in the opened stack will be displayed.</p><h2 id="help" tabindex="-1">Help</h2><p>For popup help on a particular menu item or button, select Help ... Show Balloons and hover over an item. This is a Mac OS feature and is not specific to HyperCard. To turn this off, select Help ... Hide Balloons.</p><h2 id="domains" tabindex="-1">Domains</h2><p>Cards have two domains, a background and a foreground (referred to as &quot;card&quot;). Each domain can contain painted objects (e.g. a filled rectangle), buttons, and fields. Fields display text and can allow users to enter text.</p><p>A background can be shared by any number of cards in its stack. Objects in the background of the current card that are not obscured by objects in card are visible.</p><p>When a button or field is created, it is automatically assigned a part number and an ID. Both are unique within their domain which is a specific background or card.</p><p>The ID values never change and are never reused, even if a button or field is deleted.</p><p>There are five kinds of &quot;objects&quot; in HyperCard, stacks, cards, backgrounds, buttons, and fields.</p><p>Part numbers specify stacking order where objects with higher part numbers are drawn on top of objects with lower part numbers. All objects in the card domain are drawn on top of all objects in the background domain. For more detail, see the &quot;Layers&quot; section below.</p><h2 id="stacks" tabindex="-1">Stacks</h2><p>A stack is a collection of cards that all have the same size. Each stack can use a different card size.</p><p>A stack can be thought of as an application that runs in HyperCard OR as a database table with a user interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.</p><p>Each stack is stored in its own file in the Finder. All changes made to the cards in a stack are automatically saved. This includes modifying the content of fields, adding cards, and deleting cards.</p><p>Many HyperCard windows can be open simultaneously. These include windows for stacks, scripts, and palettes. If multiple windows are open, select Go ... Next Window or press cmd-l to move focus to the next one.</p><p>A stack can be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a homogeneous stack, all the cards have the same background. In a heterogeneous stack, the cards use more than one background. An example is a stack that begins with a table of contents card that contains buttons that link to all other cards which share a different background. TODO: Learn how to implement this.</p><p>A table of contents card can have multiple levels. For example, it can have a list of categories on the left and a list of topics on the right. Clicking a category on the left can change the list of topics displayed on the right. Clicking a topic can navigate to a card that provides details on the topic. TODO: See page 74 in HyperCard Handbook. Learn how to implement this.</p><p>A stack can contain links to cards in other stacks.</p><p>Stacks are not meant to be concurrently modified by multiple users.</p><h3 id="home-stack" tabindex="-1">Home Stack</h3><p>HyperCard ships with several stacks including one named &quot;Home&quot;. If the Home stack is not currently open, it can be opened by selecting Go ... Home or pressing cmd-h.</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Home stack" style="width: 60%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-home-stack.jpg?v=1.1.1"></p><p>When HyperCard is launched, it looks for the file <code>Home</code> in the following locations in this order:</p><ol><li><code>System Folder</code> at the root of the drive containing the HyperCard app</li><li>directory containing another stack that was double clicked to launch HyperCard</li><li>directory containing the HyperCard app (default location of <code>Home</code> file)</li><li><code>HyperCard Stacks</code> directory in the director containing the HyperCard app</li><li>root directory of the drive containing the HyperCard app</li></ol><p>If the Home stack is not found in one of these locations, a dialog will appear asking you to locate it.</p><p>The default Home stack contains nine cards.</p><ul><li><p>&quot;Welcome to HyperCard&quot; contains buttons to open several stacks.</p><p>To jump to this card, select Home ... Home Cards.</p><p>The stacks include:</p><ul><li>HyperCard Tour</li><li>HyperCard Help</li><li>Art Bits: a collection of clip art that can be copied and pasted into your stacks</li><li>Addresses: a sample address book</li><li>Graph Maker: displays bar, column, line, and pie charts</li><li>and more</li></ul></li><li><p>&quot;Stack Kit&quot; contains buttons to open several stacks including:</p><ul><li>Readymade Buttons</li><li>Readymade Fields</li><li>Stack Templates</li><li>Power Tools</li><li>Background Art</li><li>HyperTalk Reference</li><li>Color Tools</li><li>HyperTalk AppleScript Reference</li><li>Apple Event Primer</li><li>AppleScript Library</li></ul></li><li><p>&quot;Card 3&quot;, &quot;Card 4&quot;, and &quot;Card 5&quot;</p><p>These are excellent places to add buttons that open:</p><ul><li>your stacks</li><li>other applications</li><li>documents in other applications</li></ul></li><li><p>&quot;Search Paths&quot;</p><p>This is a set of three cards that list in order the paths that HyperCard will search to find stacks, applications, and documents. To jump to the first of these cards, select Home ... Search Paths.</p></li><li><p>&quot;Preferences&quot;</p><p>To jump to this card, select Home ... Preference. This enables specifying the following preferences:</p><ul><li><p>Your name</p><p>The string entered here is saved in the global variable <code>UserName</code>. It can be used in scripts like the one below that can be added to a button.</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on mouseUp<br>  global UserName<br>  answer "Hello," && UserName & "!"<br>end mouseUp</code></pre></li><li><p>User level: 1 through 5</p></li><li><p>Blind Typing</p><p>When no field has focus and the message box is open, all typed characters are added to the message box because it gets focus by default. When &quot;blind typing&quot; is enabled, and no field has focus, all typed characters are added to the message box even when the message box is not open.</p></li><li><p>Power Keys</p><p>This enables issuing commands related to the painting tools by pressing the letter, digit, <code>[</code>, and <code>]</code> keys.</p><p>Examples include:</p><ul><li>1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 set the line thickness to that number of pixels</li><li><code>a</code> selects all the painting on the current card (not buttons or fields)</li><li><code>c</code> toggles draw centered on and off</li><li><code>d</code> darkens all pixels in the selected region</li><li><code>e</code> traces the edges of the current shape; can apply repeatedly</li><li><code>g</code> toggles snap to grid on and off</li><li><code>h</code> flips the selection horizontally</li><li><code>i</code> inverts all the pixels in the selected area</li><li><code>l</code> lightens all pixels in the selected region</li><li><code>v</code> flips the selection vertically</li><li><code>[</code> rotates the selection left 90 degrees</li><li><code>]</code> rotates the selection right 90 degrees</li></ul></li><li><p>Arrow Keys in Text</p><p>By default, pressing the arrow keys navigates to other cards. Checking this checkbox enables using all four arrow keys to move the cursor inside focused fields.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="stack-creation" tabindex="-1">Stack Creation</h3><p>There are three ways to open an existing stack.</p><ol><li>Double-click its file in the Finder.</li><li>In the HyperCard app, select File ... Open Stack...</li><li>In the HyperCard app, from the Home stack, click a button that opens the stack.</li></ol><p>Multiple stacks can be open at the same time, each it its own window.</p><p>To create a new stack from stack template:</p><ul><li><p>Open the Home stack.</p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Stack Kit&quot; button on the bottom row.</p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Stack Templates&quot; button to display a list of templates.</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Stack Kit card" style="width: 60%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-stack-kit-card.png?v=1.1.1"></p></li><li><p>Click the name of one of the 15 stack templates.</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Stack Templates" style="width: 60%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-stack-templates.png?v=1.1.1"></p></li><li><p>In the dialog that appears on top of the template:</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Todo List template" style="width: 60%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-todo-list-template.png?v=1.1.1"></p><ul><li>Click the lightbulb button to display information about the template.</li><li>Click the &quot;Create Stack&quot; button to create a new stack using the selected template.</li><li>Click the house icon to return the Home stack.</li><li>Click the &quot;Templates&quot; button to return to the list of templates.</li><li>Click the left arrow to go to the previous template.</li><li>Click the right arrow to go to the next template.</li></ul></li></ul><p>To create a new stack from scratch:</p><ul><li><p>Select File ...

However, this can require rearranging the objects on each card, especially if the size is reduced.</p></li><li><p>Optionally check &quot;Copy current background&quot; to copy the background of the currently open stack into the new stack.</p></li><li><p>Optionally check &quot;Open stack in new window&quot; to keep the stack currently being viewed open.</p></li><li><p>Click the Save button.</p></li></ul><h3 id="stack-opening" tabindex="-1">Stack Opening</h3><p>To open an existing stack:</p><ul><li>Select File ... Open Stack...</li><li>In the dialog that appears, navigate to the stack to open.</li><li>Optionally check the &quot;Open stack in new window&quot; checkbox.</li><li>Click the &quot;Open&quot; button.</li></ul><p>At least one stack window must be open. To close another stack that is open in its own window, click its close box in the upper-left, press cmd-w, or select File ...

New Link to Document...</li><li>In the dialog that appears, select a document.</li><li>Click the &quot;Open&quot; button.</li><li>In the dialog that appears, select an application that can open the document.</li><li>Click the &quot;Open&quot; button.</li></ol><p>The Home stack initially contains buttons labeled &quot;Card 3&quot;, &quot;Card 4&quot;, and &quot;Card 5&quot; that navigate to a card with the same name. To rename these buttons and their associated card, go to one of the cards, select Home ... Rename This Card, enter the new name in the dialog that appears, and click the &quot;OK&quot; button. For example, consider renaming &quot;Card 3&quot; to &quot;My Stacks&quot; if that is where you place links to your stacks.</p><h3 id="stack-information" tabindex="-1">Stack Information</h3><p>To get information about the current stack:</p><ul><li><p>Select Objects ... Stack Info... to open a Stack Info dialog.</p><p>This enables renaming the stack, resizing it, and editing its script.

Next Window or press cmd-l.</p><h3 id="stack-backgrounds" tabindex="-1">Stack Backgrounds</h3><p>To view and optionally edit a background used by the current card:</p><ul><li>Open the stack.</li><li>Navigate to a card that uses the background.</li><li>Select Edit ... Background or press cmd-b to toggle background mode. This is indicated by a hatched pattern in the menu bar. The card layer is temporarily hidden and only the background layer is displayed.</li></ul><h3 id="stack-sharing" tabindex="-1">Stack Sharing</h3><p>To share a stack with others, send them the stack file. They can open the stack by double clicking it, or by launching HyperCard and selecting File ... Open Stack...</p><h3 id="card-sorting" tabindex="-1">Card Sorting</h3><p>To sort all the cards currently in a stack based on the content of a background field (appears on every card), open the message box and enter a command like <code>sort by field dogName</code>. This changes the number of each card in the stack, but not their IDs.</p><p>Newly added cards are not automatically places in the current sort order because the contents of their fields is not known when the card is created.</p><p>To automatically resort the stack each time it is opened, select Objects ... Stack Info..., click the Script button, and add a handler like the following:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on openStack<br>  sort by field dogName<br>end openStack</code></pre><h3 id="stack-compacting" tabindex="-1">Stack Compacting</h3><p>When changes are made in a stack, such as entering text in a field, HyperCard allocates extra space in anticipation of more space being needed later. This makes future changes more efficient because it isn't always necessary to allocate more space. In large stacks that have undergone many changes, this can result in quite a bit of allocated space that is unused ... referred to as &quot;free space&quot;.</p><p>To see the amount of free space in a stack, open it and select Objects ... Stack Info... . In the dialog that appears, the total amount of disk space used by the stack is listed after &quot;Size of stack&quot; and the amount of free space is listed after &quot;Free in stack&quot;.</p><p>The free space can be removed, reducing the size of the stack, by selecting File ... Compact Stack. This also verifies the internal structure of the stack and is able to fix some issues.</p><p>It is recommended to periodically compact all stacks, perhaps daily for frequently modified stacks.</p><h3 id="stack-protection" tabindex="-1">Stack Protection</h3><p>To protect a stack from user actions, open the stack and select File ... Protect Stack... which opens the following dialog:</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Protect Stack dialog" style="width: 50%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-protect-stack.png?v=1.1.1"></p><p>If the user level of the stack causes the &quot;Protect Stack...&quot; menu item to be missing from &quot;File&quot; menu, hold down the command key when opening the File menu to reveal it.</p><p>When the &quot;Can't Modify Stack&quot; checkbox is checked, users can browse the stack, but are prevented from making any changes including modifying the text in fields.</p><p>When the &quot;Can't Delete Stack&quot; checkbox is checked, users are prevented from deleting the stack.</p><p>When the &quot;Can't Abort&quot; checkbox is checked, are prevented from aborting operations by pressing cmd-period. This can be useful in stacks that run in kiosk settings,</p><p>When the &quot;Can't Peek&quot; checkbox is checked, prevents users from seeing:</p><ul><li>the locations of buttons by pressing cmd-option</li><li>the locations of fields by pressing cmd-shift-option</li></ul><p>When the &quot;Private Access&quot; checkbox is checked, users must enter a password in order to access the stack. If no password has been specified, a dialog for entering one will be opened.</p><p>The radio buttons under &quot;Limit user level to&quot; set the default user level that is active when the stack is opened.</p><p>The &quot;Set Password...&quot; button opens a dialog where a password can be entered. If the &quot;Private Access&quot; checkbox is checked, users must enter this password (once per HyperCard session) in order to open the stack. Regardless of the &quot;Private Access&quot; setting, users must enter this password in order to open the &quot;Protect Stack&quot; dialog.</p><p>Users that have access to a stack file can find ways in the HyperCard app to bypass its password protection.

Find... or press cmd-f. Then enter search text inside the provided double quotes and press the return key to go to the next occurrence of a field containing matching text.</p><p>Key facts about the <code>find</code> command are:</p><ul><li>The search is case-insensitive.</li><li>The matching text is surrounded by a black rectangle.</li><li>Only fields are searched, not button labels or painted text.</li><li>If no match is found, the beep sound is played.</li><li>The last search is remembered. If you begin a new search later, the previous search text will be in the quotes.</li><li>When the search string contains spaces, they are treated as delimiters between search terms. The search is for the next card with a field containing a word that <strong>begins</strong> with each of the search terms. The words are not required to be in the same field. For example, <code>find &quot;com whip&quot;</code> matches a card with a field that contains &quot;Comet Fireball&quot; AND a field that contains &quot;Brindle Whippet&quot;.</li><li>Multi-term searches are AND searches, not OR searches.</li></ul><p>To repeat the search to find the next occurrence, possibly on the same card, press the return key. After the last occurrence is found, the search wraps around to the first card in the stack.</p><p>The <code>find words</code> command matches cards with fields that contain complete words that match the search terms. For example, <code>find words &quot;comet whippet&quot;</code> matches a card with a field that contains &quot;Comet Fireball&quot; AND a field that contains &quot;Brindle Whippet&quot;.</p><p>The <code>find whole</code> command matches cards with a single field that contains the specified words in order. For example, <code>find whole &quot;comet fireball&quot;</code> matches a card with a field that contains &quot;Comet Fireball&quot;, but does not match a card with a field that contains &quot;Comet the Fireball&quot;. This command can be entered in the message box by pressing cmd-shift-f.</p><p>The <code>find chars</code> command matches substrings. For example, <code>find chars &quot;ome pet&quot;</code> matches a card with a field that contains &quot;Comet Fireball&quot; AND a field that contains &quot;Brindle Whippet&quot;.</p><p>HyperCard does not treat the characters &quot;?&quot; and &quot;*&quot; in search terms like wildcards. Instead of using <code>find chars &quot;wh*pet&quot;</code>and hoping to match &quot;Whippet&quot;, use<code>find chars &quot;wh pet&quot;</code> which is almost the same. It differs in that words containing &quot;wh&quot; and &quot;pet&quot; can be found in different fields of the same card.</p><p>The <code>find string</code> command is similar to <code>find chars</code>, but it treats the search string as a single term even if it contains spaces. It matches cards with a single matching field. For example, <code>find string &quot;met fir&quot;</code> matches a card with a field that contains &quot;Comet Fireball&quot;.</p><p>To treat accented characters the same as their non-accented counterparts when finding matches, add the keyword <code>international</code> after <code>find</code> in any of the <code>find</code> commands described above. For example, this treats the character é the same as the character e.</p><h3 id="card-issues" tabindex="-1">Card Issues</h3><p>Sadly there is no easy way to:</p><ul><li>reorder the cards in a stack</li><li>change the background used by an existing card</li></ul><p>These seem like large oversights!</p><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools</h2><p>The tools menu contains a grid of buttons that can be clicked to select one of the 18 tools.

Drag around an arbitrary portion of the painted area. When the mouse button is released, the dragged path will automatically be closed, as if with a straight line to the starting point. Each contiguous set of black pixels inside the selected area will be surrounded by a path of marching ants. The selection is the combined contents of those paths, not the entire contents of the lassoed area. The selection can then be copied, cut, deleted, or dragged.</p><p>The modifier keys that affect the Selection tool affect the Lasso tool in mostly the same way.</p><p>To select all the items in the picture layer of the current domain (background or card), double click this tool.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pencil</strong></p><p>The Pencil tool is used for freehand drawing which is accomplished by dragging. The pencil width is a single pixel is not affected by selecting a different size from Options ...

In a background domain this changes black pixels to white. In a card domain this changes black and white pixels to transparent, revealing black pixels in the background.</p><p>To erase large areas, it is more efficient to select an area using the Selection or Lasso tool and then press the delete key.</p><p>For fine grained erasing, use &quot;Fat Bits&quot; mode.</p><p>Hold the shift key down while dragging to constrain the eraser movement to be horizontal or vertical, depending on the initial drag direction.</p><p>To erase all painting the current domain (background or card), double click this tool. Undo to restore everything that was erased. To keep a selected area and erase all the rest, select the area to keep, copy it to the clipboard, double click this tool, and paste the copied area.</p><p>It's too bad that the Erase shape and size is not determined by the selected brush shape.</p></li><li><p><strong>Line</strong></p><p>The Line tool draws a straight line. Click the start pixel and drag to end pixel.</p><p>To change the line width from the default of 1 pixel, Select Options ... Line Size... or double click this tool before drawing.

This is most often used to create horizontal (0 or 180 degrees) or vertical (90 or 270 degrees) lines.</p><p>To draw the line using the selected pattern, hold down the option key before dragging. The painted pattern is not affected by the angle of the line.</p><p>To draw a dotted line:</p><ol><li>Double click the Line tool.</li><li>Select a line width of 1 pixel.</li><li>Select one of the provided patterns such as 3, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14, 17, or 19.</li><li>Hold down the shift and option keys.</li><li>Drag to create a dotted line that is horizontal or vertical.</li></ol><p>To draw a dashed line:</p><ol><li>Double click the Line tool.</li><li>Select a line width of 1 pixel.</li><li>Edit one of the patterns to match the screenshot below.</li><li>Select that pattern.</li><li>Hold down the shift and option keys.</li><li>Drag to create a dashed line that is horizontal or vertical.</li></ol><p><img alt="HyperCard dashed line pattern" style="width: 30%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-dashed-line-pattern.png?v=1.1.1"></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Row #4</p><ul><li><p><strong>Spray</strong></p><p>The Spray tool sprays paint (black pixels) using randomly chosen pixels from the selected pattern. The more this is applied to a specific area, the more it will resemble the selected pattern.</p><p>The speed of the drag affects the number of pixels that are painted, with slow drags painting more pixels.</p><p>Hold the shift key down while dragging to constrain the spray movement to be horizontal or vertical, depending on the initial drag direction.</p><p>To spray white pixels instead of black, hold down the cmd key while dragging.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rectangle</strong></p><p>The Rectangle tool draws a rectangle. Click the location of any corner and drag to the opposite corner.</p><p>To draw a square, hold down the shift key while dragging.</p><p>To specify the center point of the rectangle and drag out its size from there, select Options ... Draw Centered before dragging out the rectangle. The center of the cross cursor will turn white to indicate being in this mode and aid it locating the desired center pixel.</p><p>The &quot;Draw Centered&quot; mode can be used to draw concentric shapes of all types. Begin by drawing a dot at the target center. Draw each shape by starting at this center location and dragging outward. Finally, erase the dot at the center.</p><p>To move the rectangle as it is being drawn, keep the mouse button down, hold the cmd key down, and drag to a new location. To continue drawing the rectangle, release the cmd key, but keep the mouse button down and continue dragging.</p><p>To toggle the &quot;Draw Filled&quot; option, double click this tool as an alternative to selecting Options ... Draw Filled.</p><p>To draw the border using the selected line thickness and pattern, hold down the option key before the initial corner click. Combine this with the &quot;Draw Filled&quot; option to use the same pattern for both the border and the fill, resulting in a rectangle that appears to have no border.</p><p>To draw a dashed line border, select a line width of 1 pixel, edit one of the patterns to match the screenshot below, select that pattern, and draw the rectangle with the option key held down.</p><p><img alt="HyperCard dashed line pattern" style="width: 30%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-dashed-line-pattern.png?v=1.1.1"></p></li><li><p><strong>Round Rectangle</strong></p><p>The Round Rectangle tool draws a rectangle with rounded corners. It is used in the same way as the Rectangle tool, with all the same keyboard shortcuts.</p><p>The size of the rounded corners cannot be adjusted. The only option to obtain a different rounded corner size is to draw a normal rectangle and use &quot;Fat Bits&quot; mode to manually edit the corners. This is quite tedious.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Row #5</p><ul><li><p><strong>Bucket</strong></p><p>The Bucket tool fills an area encompassed by black pixels with the selected pattern from the Patterns menu or palette. The cursor changes to match the Bucket tool icon. Position the bottom top of the dripping paint in the cursor icon over a pixel inside the area to be filled and click.</p><p>When a solid black area is filled with the Bucket tool, all the black pixels, including the border, are replaced by the selected pattern.</p><p>To toggle display of the Patterns palette, double click this tool.</p></li><li><p><strong>Oval</strong></p><p>The Oval tool draws an oval which is any closed curve that resembles the outline of an egg or an ellipse. It doesn't have a strict mathematical definition.</p><p>This tool is used in the same way as the Rectangle tool.</p><p>To draw a circle, hold down the shift key while dragging.</p><p>To draw a portion of an oval, draw a complete oval and erase the undesired part.</p></li><li><p><strong>Curve</strong></p><p>The Curve tool is similar to the Pencil tool, but it:</p><ul><li>uses the selected line width</li><li>automatically closes the shape and fills it if Options ...

The text can then be dragged to a new location.</p><p>As long as you have not clicked away from the text being typed, its text properties can be changed. Opening the &quot;Text Properties&quot; dialog again and changing them affects the text already typed and the text that will be typed after the dialog is closed.</p><p>To apply a pattern to painted text, see the &quot;Patterns&quot; section below.</p><p>Pros of painted text:</p><ul><li>Users do not need to have the selected font installed because the text is stored in bitmap form.</li><li>The text is automatically read-only. Using a field instead requires opening its &quot;Field Info&quot; dialog and checking the &quot;Lock Text&quot; checkbox.</li></ul><p>Cons of painted text:</p><ul><li>The bitmap representation requires more disk space than would be used by the same text in a locked field.</li><li>The text cannot be modified later. Changes require erasing the text and recreating it. For text that may need to be edited later, use a locked field instead.</li><li>All the characters in one set of painted text must use the same text properties. To use multiple text properties settings, create multiple sets of painted text and position them next to each other. The text in a field can used multiple text properties settings.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Regular Polygon</strong></p><p>The Regular Polygon tool draws a convex polygon whose sides all have the same length.

Unfortunately the clickable area must be rectangular. Modify the button script to execute HyperTalk commands when clicked.</p><h3 id="scripting-buttons" tabindex="-1">Scripting Buttons</h3><p>The script associated with a button can define handlers that are invoked when the user interacts with the button. When a button is created, it is automatically given a script with an empty handler (no commands) for <code>mouseUp</code> messages. This is the most commonly implemented handler for buttons.</p><p>There are three ways to view and edit the script for a button:</p><ol><li>Select the Button tool, double click the button to open its &quot;Button Info&quot; dialog, and click the &quot;Script...&quot; button.</li><li>Select the Button tool, hold down the shift key, and double click the button.</li><li>Hold down cmd-option and click the button.</li></ol><p>To detect whether special keys where held down during a click, check the state of the special variables <code>commandKey</code>, <code>optionKey</code>, and <code>shiftKey</code>. There is no support for detecting that the control key is down. The following code demonstrates special key detection:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on mouseUp<br>  if the commandKey is down then<br>    put "command" into whichKey<br>  else if the optionKey is down then<br>    put "option" into whichKey<br>  else if the shiftKey is down then<br>    put "shift" into whichKey<br>  else<br>    put "none" into whichKey<br>  end if<br>  answer "key =" && whichKey<br>end mouseUp</code></pre><p>To change the text on a button in a handler:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">set name of {button-reference} to "new-text"</code></pre><p>To allow a button to be dragged to a new location, add the following handler in its script. This isn't particularly useful, but it demonstrates changing the location of an object based on the current mouse location.</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on mouseStillDown<br>  set the location of me to the mouseLoc<br>end mouseStillDown</code></pre><p>If several buttons are clicked while a handler is executing, only messages for the last button clicked will be delivered. To demonstrate this, create three buttons that each have <code>mouseUp</code> handler. In the first handler, do the following:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">beep<br>wait 2 seconds<br>beep</code></pre><p>In the second handler, do the following:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">play flute<br>wait 1 second</code></pre><p>In the third handler, do the following:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">play harpsichord<br>wait 1 second</code></pre><p>Clicking all three buttons in order results in a beep, a delay, another beep, and the harpsichord sound. The handler for the second button is never invoked because the system was busy running the handler for the first button when it was clicked and it was not the last button clicked while the system was busy.</p><h3 id="check-boxes" tabindex="-1">Check Boxes</h3><p>To get the value of a check box, use the command <code>get [the] hilite of {button-reference}</code>.</p><p>To put the value of a check box into the message box for testing, use the command <code>put [the] hilite of {button-reference} into message [box]</code>.</p><p>The &quot;Button Info&quot; dialog for background checkboxes contains the checkbox &quot;Shared Hilite&quot; which is not present for card checkboxes. When this is checked, the state of the checkbox is shared across all cards that use the background. When this is unchecked, each card that uses the background has its own state for the checkbox.</p><h3 id="radio-buttons" tabindex="-1">Radio Buttons</h3><p>To get the name of the selected radio button:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">function selectedButtonName familyNumber<br>  repeat with i = 1 to the number of buttons<br>    if the family of button i is familyNumber then<br>      if the hilite of button i then<br>        return the short name of button i<br>      end if<br>    end if<br>  end repeat<br>  return empty<br>end selectedButtonName<br><br>on mouseUp<br>  put selectedButtonName(3) -- updates the message box<br>end mouseUp</code></pre><p>The &quot;Button Info&quot; dialog for background radio buttons contains the checkbox &quot;Shared Hilite&quot; which is not present for card radio buttons.

Each element is displayed in its own layer within the &quot;document layer&quot;.</p><p>To set the visibility of all painted object on the current card or background, use the following command:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">set showPict of this {background|card} to {true|false}`.</code></pre><p>All painted objects appear below buttons and fields. So buttons and fields are never obscured by painted objects.</p><p>The order in which elements are created determines their initial stacking order, with the newer elements on top of older elements.</p><p>The stacking order of buttons and fields with their domain can be changed. To do so:</p><ul><li>Select the Button or Field tool.</li><li>Selecting the button or field whose order will be changed.</li><li>Select Objects ... Bring Closer (cmd-plus) to increase the part number.</li><li>Select Objects ... Send Farther (cmd-minus) to decrease the part number.</li></ul><p>To move an object to the extreme end of the stacking order, hold down the shift key when issuing the command.</p><p>For fields, the stacking order affects the order in which they are visited when the tab key is pressed. If the focus is in a background field, repeatedly pressing the tab key visits each of the remaining background fields that are higher the stacking order before visiting each of the card fields. If the focus is in a card field, repeatedly pressing the tab key visits each of the remaining card fields that are higher the stacking order before visiting each of the background fields. It is not possible to set a stacking order that alternates between background and foreground fields.</p><p>When the mouse is clicked, only one element receives the message ... the element that overlaps the click location and is in the closest layer.</p><h2 id="sounds" tabindex="-1">Sounds</h2><p>To play a predefined sound, use the <code>beep</code> or <code>play</code> commands. The <code>beep</code> command takes an optional argument that specifies the number of times to play, defaulting to one. The <code>play</code> command takes the following arguments:</p><ul><li>name of a sound, either <code>boing</code> or <code>harpsichord</code></li><li>optional keyword <code>tempo</code> followed by a number (seems to default to 120)</li><li>optional set of notes to play in double quotes</li></ul><p>For example, <code>play harpsichord tempo 120 &quot;c4 e g4 e c5 q&quot;</code></p><p>Sound resources can be copied from other files such as:</p><ul><li>the <code>System</code> file in the directory <code>System Folder</code></li><li>application files (e.g. cow in HyperCard 2.4:Your Tour of HyperCard:HyperCard Tour)</li><li>a HyperCard stack (e.g. &quot;Ghost Laugh&quot; in Documents:HyperCard Stacks:Haunted House:The Haunted House 1.0.2)</li></ul><p>To copy a sound response (type &quot;snd&quot;) from another file:</p><ol><li>Install the ResEdit application if not already installed.</li><li>Launch ResEdit.</li><li>Open the source stack or application in ResEdit.</li><li>Double-click on &quot;snd&quot; to view its sound resources.</li><li>Click a resource to select it.</li><li>Press cmd-c to copy it.</li><li>Open the destination stack in ResEdit.</li><li>Press cmd-v to paste the copied &quot;snd&quot; resource.</li><li>Press cmd-s to save the changes.</li><li>Press cmd-q to quit ResEdit.</li></ol><p>The copied sound can now be played with the command <code>play &quot;{snd-resource-name}&quot;</code>. In a handler, consider using the command <code>play stop</code> before this command to stop any sound that is already playing before playing another.</p><p>To play a sound file, use the <code>play file {sound-file-path}</code> command. Supposedly the AIFF sound format is the most reliable. TODO: I could not get this to work!</p><p>To record new sounds, see the &quot;Sounds&quot; section in the &quot;iMac G3&quot; blog page.</p><h2 id="importing-graphics" tabindex="-1">Importing Graphics</h2><p>Graphics can be imported from files that use the MacPaint format, such as the MacPaint application.</p><p>To create graphics in MacPaint and import them into a HyperCard stack:</p><ol><li>Launch MacPaint.</li><li>Create graphics using its painting tools which are nearly identical to those in HyperCard.</li><li>Save the graphics in a file.</li><li>Launch HyperCard.</li><li>Open the target stack.</li><li>Choose the target domain (background or card).</li><li>Choose the specific target background or card.</li><li>Select any painting tool so the following menu item is available.</li><li>Select File ... Import Paint...</li><li>Select the file created earlier.</li><li>Select the pasted graphics and move them to the desired location.</li><li>Optionally edited the imported graphics.</li></ol><h2 id="exporting-graphics" tabindex="-1">Exporting Graphics</h2><p>The painting layer of the current card or background can be exported to a file that uses the MacPaint format. This includes buttons (along with their icons) and fields (including text entered into them).</p><p>To export the current painting layer:</p><ol><li>Navigate to the card or background whose graphics will be exported.</li><li>Select any painting tool so the following menu item is available.</li><li>Select File ... Export Paint...</li><li>Select the target directory.</li><li>Enter a file name.</li><li>Click the &quot;Save&quot; button.</li></ol><p>It seems that the right edge is cut off.</p><h2 id="backgrounds" tabindex="-1">Backgrounds</h2><p>Every stack has at least one background, but it can be empty. Often backgrounds have a design that mimics something in real life such as an address book, calendar, notebook, or paper form. They can contain buttons and fields that appear on every card that uses the background. Each background field stores a different value for each card that uses the background.</p><p>Every card has an associated background. When a new card is created, it uses the background of the current card. When a card is cut and then pasted in a new location within the stack, it retains its background.</p><p>To edit the properties of the background of the current card, select Objects ... Bkgnd Info... which opens the following dialog:</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Background Info" style="width: 45%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-background-info.png?v=1.1.1"></p><p>Assigning a name to a background is optional, but they are handy when printing reports and they enable accessing backgrounds by name in scripts.</p><p>To prevent a background from being deleted, check the &quot;Can't Delete Background&quot; checkbox. When this is checked, if a user tries to delete the last card that uses the background, a dialog will open that says &quot;Can't delete last card of protected background&quot;.</p><p>To switch to background mode, which temporarily hides the foreground of the current card and only displays its background, select Edit ... Background or press cmd-b. Repeat to return to foreground mode which displays the foreground and background of the current card.</p><p>To add a new background to the current stack, select Objects ... New Background. This creates a new card that uses the new background, but it will not be in background mode. Press cmd-b to enter background mode and add content. Then press cmd-b again to enter foreground mode and add content. Cards created after this one will use the new background by default.</p><p>If some cards that use a particular background do not wish to display all the elements in the background layer, those elements can be covered by elements in the card layer. For example, a rectangle that is filled with white can be used to hide painted elements, buttons, and fields.</p><p>To draw a white rectangle without a black border:</p><ul><li>Select Options ... Draw Filled.</li><li>Select solid white from the Patterns menu or palette.</li><li>Select the Rectangle tool from the Tools menu or palette.</li><li>Hold down the option key while dragging out the rectangle.</li></ul><p>To copy a background and create a new background that starts out with the same configuration, TODO: ???</p><p>To create multiple backgrounds that have some common elements, the common elements must be copied from one background to the others.</p><p>To assign/change the name of a background, select Options ... Bkgnd Info... and enter/change the &quot;Background Name&quot;.</p><p>In a stack that uses multiple backgrounds, button and field names can be duplicated across the backgrounds. This enables background scripts to use the same code for referring to those containers.</p><p>It seems there is no way to change the background used by an existing card. The only option seems to be copying the content from the existing card to a new card that use the desired background.</p><h2 id="card-transitions" tabindex="-1">Card Transitions</h2><p>To add a transition effect that occurs on card navigation, add a script like the following to each button whose handler navigates to a new card. In the <code>visual</code> command, the keyword <code>effect</code> is optional.</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on mouseUp<br>  visual effect wipe right slowly<br>  go to previous card<br>end mouseUp<br><br>on mouseUp<br>  visual effect wipe left slowly<br>  go to next card<br>end mouseUp</code></pre><p>There are 27 effects and five speeds. To specify a visual effect that is trigger by a specific button:</p><ol><li>Select the Button tool.</li><li>Double-click the button to open its &quot;Button Info&quot; dialog.</li><li>Click the &quot;Tasks...&quot; button.</li><li>Select &quot;Visual Effect&quot; in the left list.</li><li>Select an effect from the center list.</li><li>Select a speed from the right radio buttons.</li><li>Click the &quot;Assign Tasks&quot; button.</li></ol><p>This adds a <code>visual effect</code> command to the <code>mouseUp</code> handler. If one is already present, it is replaced.</p><p>Clicking the button will only exercise the visual effect if the button has also been configured to navigate to another card. To configure this, open the &quot;Button Info&quot; dialog for the button and do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Click the &quot;LinkTo...&quot; button and follow the instructions for this in the &quot;Creating Buttons&quot; section above.</li><li>Click the &quot;Tasks...&quot; button and follow the instructions for this in the &quot;Creating Buttons&quot; section above.</li><li>Click the &quot;Scripts...&quot; button and manually add a <code>go</code> command after the <code>visual</code> command.</li></ul><p>The &quot;LinkTo...&quot; and &quot;Tasks...&quot; options add a <code>go</code> command to the <code>mouseUp</code> handler. If one is already present, it is replaced.</p><h2 id="images" tabindex="-1">Images</h2><p>One source of images is other stacks.</p><p>For example, the &quot;Art Bits&quot; stack is linked from the first card of the Home stack. It contains links to the cards with images in the following categories: Beasts, Buildings, Communication and media, HyperCard miscellany, Icon ideas, Macintosh miscellany, Nature and science, Odds and ends, People, Small treasures, and Transportation.</p><p>Another source is the stacks linked from the &quot;Stack Kit&quot; card of the Home stack. See &quot;Readymade Buttons&quot;, &quot;Readymade Fields&quot;, &quot;Stack Templates&quot;, and &quot;Background Art&quot;.</p><p>To get an image, open a stack, find a desired image on one of its cards, use the selection tools to select it, copy it, and paste it onto a card in your stack.</p><p>TODO: What image formats can be pasted into cards?</p><h2 id="color" tabindex="-1">Color</h2><p>Some amount of color support was added to HyperCard in version 2.3. To use colors, install the color tools. This requires more than the default amount of memory. To add more memory:</p><ul><li>Quit HyperCard if it is running.</li><li>Locate and select the HyperCard app in the Finder.</li><li>Press cmd-i to open its Info dialog.</li><li>In the Show dropdown, select Memory.</li><li>Try changing the &quot;Minimum Size&quot; to 5000 K and the &quot;Preferred Size&quot; to 10000 K.</li><li>Close the Info dialog.</li><li>Launch HyperCard.</li></ul><p>To enable use of colors:</p><ul><li>Click &quot;Color Tools are OFF&quot; on the Home card to toggle it ON. This will add a Color menu that contains the menu item &quot;Open Coloring Tools&quot;.</li><li>Select that menu item to open the color palette. This has buttons labeled Button, Field, Pict, Rect, and Paint at the top.</li><li>Select one of the buttons to indicate the kind of object for which a color will be selected.</li><li>Select a color.</li></ul><p>TODO: Why does the Tools menu disappear when the Color palette is open?</p><h2 id="scroll-window" tabindex="-1">Scroll Window</h2><p>The scroll window enables scrolling in a stack window. It is useful when the card size of a stack is larger than the monitor. This is not typically the case, so this tool is rarely used.</p><p>To toggle display of the scroll window, select Go ... Scroll or press cmd-e.</p><p>The black rectangle in the scroll window represents the visible size of the stack with focus.</p><p>There are two ways to change the viewable size of the stack window.</p><ol><li>Drag any edge or corner of the rectangle in the scroll window.</li><li>Press cmd-shift-e and drag the grow box that appears in the lower-right corner of the stack window.</li></ol><p>To change the portion of the stack window that is visible, drag the rectangle in scroll window.</p><p>To toggle the viewable size between full size and the last reduced size, double click the rectangle in the scroll window or click the zoom box in the upper-right corner of the stack window. The rectangle cannot be dragged if its size is the same as the scroll window.</p><p>The screenshot below shows the scroll Window after its rectangle has been resized and dragged. It also shows the portion of the Home stack that is visible based on the state of the scroll window.</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Scroll Window" style="width: 70%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-scroll-window.png?v=1.1.1"></p><h2 id="menu-bar" tabindex="-1">Menu Bar</h2><p>To hide the menu bar that typically appears at the top of the screen, use the command <code>hide menubar</code>.

The machine code for each handler and function defined in a script is stored in memory. The next time the same handlers and functions are executed, they run faster because there is no need to compile them again. This remains true unless the machine code is pushed out of memory by more newly generated machine code due to memory limits.</p><p>The commands supported by HyperTalk are documented at <a href="https://www.hypercard.center/HyperTalkReference#commands?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HyperTalk Reference</a>. Each command sends a message that is typically handled by the HyperCard application. Messages can accept arguments that become the values of corresponding parameters in a message handler.</p><p>If no handler is found for a command, a dialog opens that contains &quot;Can't understand {command-name}&quot;.</p><p>A good way to learn about HyperTalk is to examine the scripts in provided stacks such as the Home stack.</p><h3 id="message-box" tabindex="-1">Message Box</h3><p>One way to execute HyperTalk commands is to enter them in the message box. This is a single, small window that allows entry of a single HyperTalk command. If the text entered extends past the right edge, that portion will not be visible and the text cannot be scrolled horizontally. The message box can be moved, but it cannot be resized.</p><p>To toggle display of the message box, select Go ... Message or press cmd-m. Then enter commands separated by semicolons and press return to execute them.</p><p>Typing while focus is not in the message box or in a card field replaces the text in the message box. See &quot;Blind Typing&quot; in the &quot;Home Stack ... Preferences&quot; section for more detail.</p><p>To change the font family and size used in the message box, click in it to give it focus and make selections in the Font and Style menus.</p><p>If a field reference is entered in the message box, it is replaced by the contents of the field. For example, <code>card field 2</code>, <code>card field id 7</code>, or <code>card field &quot;first name&quot;</code>.</p><p>To write a value to the message box, use the command <code>put {expression} into [the] message [box]</code>. The put command writes to the message box by default, so the previous command can shorted to <code>put {expression}</code>.</p><p>The following are examples of HyperTalk commands that can be entered in the message box:</p><ul><li><p>navigation</p><ul><li><code>go to Art Bits</code> - opens the stack named &quot;Art Bits&quot;</li><li><code>go art bits</code> - same but without optional keyword <code>to</code> and without capitalizing</li></ul></li><li><p>scripts</p><ul><li><p><code>edit script of button &quot;My Button&quot;</code></p><p>This opens a script editor for a given script.

Repeatedly press cmd-g to find the next match until the line <code>on searchScript pattern,stackName</code> is found.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>mathematical expressions</p><p>The entered expression is replaced by its result.</p><ul><li><code>2 * 3</code> - gives <code>6</code></li><li><code>4 * (5 - 2)</code> - uses parentheses to control order of evaluation and gives <code>12</code></li><li><code>4^3</code> - uses exponentiation and gives <code>64</code></li><li><code>2 * pi * 3^2</code> - gives <code>56.548668</code></li><li><code>sin(45)</code> - evaluates a trigonometry function and gives <code>0.850904</code></li></ul></li><li><p>multiple commands</p><p>While only a single command can be entered, multiple commands can be described in a string with a return character between each command. The string can be passed to the <code>do</code> command to execute each of the commands.

The double ampersand adds a space between the values.</p><p>To extract a substring from a string list, use the keyword <code>of</code>. For example:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">put "apple,banana,cherry" into fruits<br>put item 2 of fruits into fruit -- sets to banana</code></pre><h4 id="booleans" tabindex="-1">Booleans</h4><p>Booleans are stored as the strings &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.</p><p>Relational operators return one of these strings and the <code>if</code> command checks for them.</p><p>TODO: Add more to this section.</p><h4 id="numbers" tabindex="-1">Numbers</h4><p>Numbers are stored as strings and converted to numbers when used in a context that requires a number.

The reason is that button names are often used as their displayed labels and a card can have multiple buttons with the same name.</p><p>To change the name of a button:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">set name of {button-ref} to {new-name}</code></pre><p>To click a button from a script:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">send mouseUp to {button-ref}</code></pre><h3 id="scripts" tabindex="-1">Scripts</h3><p>A HyperCard script is a collection of message handler and function definitions. Those contain HyperTalk commands. Often a script only contains a single handler definition. However, to aid in finding a definition inside a long script, the script editor includes dropdowns in the upper-right for selecting and scrolling to a selected handler or function.</p><p><img alt="HyperCard Script editor" style="width: 80%" src="/blog/assets/hypercard-script-editor.png?v=1.1.1"></p><p>Scripts are associated with a specific object such as a button, field, or card. They handle messages that are triggered by many actions.</p><p>Scripts are implemented with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk?v=1.1.1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HyperTalk</a> language which has an English-like syntax. The messages travel through the object hierarchy, searching for an object that handles them. The levels of the object hierarchy, from bottom to top are:</p><ul><li>target button or field</li><li>current card</li><li>current background</li><li>current stack</li><li>Home stack</li><li>HyperCard app</li></ul><p>This is also the order in which scripts are most commonly defined, with button scripts being the most common and HyperCard app scripts being the least common.</p><p>Some messages begin at a higher level (a.k.a. entry point) in the hierarchy than buttons and fields. For example, the <code>openCard</code> message begins at the card level and the <code>openStack</code> message begins at the stack level.</p><p>You cannot control which scripts will exist at the Home stack and HyperCard app levels when other users use your stacks, so it is risky to depend on those.</p><p>To open a Script editor window for any kind of object, open its &quot;Info&quot; window and click the &quot;Script...&quot; button.</p><p>The following keyboard shortcuts remove the need to open an &quot;Info&quot; window and directly open the Script editor for a given object:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Object Type</th><th>Keyboard Shortcut</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Button</td><td>select Button tool and cmd-option-click the button</td></tr><tr><td>Field</td><td>select Field tool and cmd-option-click the field</td></tr><tr><td>Background</td><td>cmd-option-b</td></tr><tr><td>Card</td><td>cmd-option-c</td></tr><tr><td>Stack</td><td>cmd-option-s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When a Script window is open, the menus change to contain script-related items.

These begin with <code>on {message-name}</code> and end with <code>end {message-name}</code>. Each message handler listens for (&quot;traps&quot;) a specific kind of message and executes the code inside when triggered.</p><p>Suppose a button has the following script:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on mouseUp<br>  help -- opens the "HyperCard Help" stack in a new window<br>end mouseUp</code></pre><p>All HyperTalk commands, including <code>help</code>, send a message. If the <code>help</code> message is not handled by scripts in the current stack, it is handled by the HyperCard application. The following can be added to the button script above to trap <code>help</code> messages and provide custom handling.</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on help<br>  answer "No soup for you!"<br>end help</code></pre><p>Only one message handler at a time can run. If one runs for a long time, perhaps by using the <code>wait</code> command, no other messages are handled until the currently running message handler completes. Some messages are queued and processed later. For some messages, only the last queued message of that type is processed later. Some queued messages are not processed. TODO: This is very confusing!</p><p>Unlike functions, message handlers cannot return a value.</p><p>For example, in a stack with two cards where the first card contains a button:</p><ol><li><p>Open the stack. The first card will be displayed.</p></li><li><p>Select the Button tool.</p></li><li><p>Double-click the button.</p></li><li><p>Click the &quot;Script&quot; button.</p></li><li><p>Enter the following:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on mouseUp<br>  go to next card<br>end mouseUp</code></pre></li><li><p>Press cmd-s to save the changes.</p></li><li><p>Press cmd-w to close the script window.</p></li><li><p>Select Objects ...

Any errors are only found when the script is run.</p><p>Message handlers for custom message names can be implemented in any script. For example:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on doubleBeep<br>  beep<br>  beep<br>end doubleBeep</code></pre><p>To send a message, just use its name. For example, <code>doubleBeep</code>. If no handler is found for the message, a dialog that says &quot;Can't understand {message}.&quot; will open.</p><p>Message handlers can have parameters that appear after the message name in a comma-separated list. For example:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">on add n1, n2<br>  answer "The sum is" && (n1 + n2) & "."<br>end add</code></pre><p>To invoke this, use an expression like <code>add 2, 3</code>.</p><h3 id="constants" tabindex="-1">Constants</h3><p>Constants are variables whose values cannot be changed.

Setting this to false can improve performance.</li><li><code>the userLevel</code>: current user level from 1 to 5</li></ul><h3 id="variables" tabindex="-1">Variables</h3><p>Variables provide a way to store a value and use it later. The value can be a Boolean, number, or string. The value can be changed any number of times to any type.</p><p>Variable names must begin with a letter and contain letters, digits, and underscores. That cannot match a reserved word which includes all commands, functions, properties, and keywords defined by HyperTalk.</p><p>Variables exist in two scopes, local to a specific handler and global across all handlers in all stacks.</p><p>Local variables are not declared and spring into existence when a value is assigned to them. The value of a local variables is lost when the message handler or function in which it is assigned ends.</p><p>Global variables must be declared everywhere they are used with the keyword <code>global</code>. For example, <code>global favoriteColor, maximumTemperature, taxRate</code> The value of a global variable is not lost when the message handler or function in which it is assigned ends. But the value is lost when HyperCard is quit.</p><p>To assign a value to a variable, use the <code>put</code> command. For example, <code>put 3.14159265 into pie</code> (<code>pi</code> is a predefined constant)</p><p>To assign a value to a property of an object (such as a stack, card, button, or field), use the <code>set</code> command. For example,<code>set the visible of button &quot;save&quot; to false</code>.</p><p>It's a good idea to initialize all global variables used by a stack in the <code>openStack</code> handler associated with the stack. This avoids using values assigned by other stacks.</p><p>HyperTalk can store the name or id of a button/field in a variable, but it cannot store a button or field object in a variable.</p><h3 id="commands" tabindex="-1">Commands</h3><h4 id="add-command" tabindex="-1">add Command</h4><p>The <code>add</code> command adds a number to the number in a given container. The numeric value of an empty container is zero. An &quot;Expected number here&quot; error occurs if the container is not empty and does not contain a number.</p><p>For example, the following commands add the values in two fields and place the result in a third field:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">put card field n1 into result<br>add card field n2 to result<br>put result into card field sum</code></pre><h4 id="get-command" tabindex="-1">get Command</h4><p>The <code>get</code> command gets the value of a container or expression and sets the value of the special variable <code>it</code> to that value. The command <code>get {expression}</code> is equivalent to <code>put {expression} into it</code>.</p><p>The following are examples of using the <code>get</code> command:</p><pre class="language-text"><code class="language-text">get 2 + 3<br>get the short date -- e.g. 4/12/25; short is the default and can be omitted<br>get the long date -- e.g. Saturday, April 12, 2025<br>get [the value of] card field "My Foreground Field"<br>get [the value of] background field "My Background Field"<br>get the label of button "My Button"<br>get the hilite of button "My Checkbox"<br>get item 2 of colorList -- where colorList is a comma-delimited string<br>get word 1 of "some long string"<br>get line 3 of field "My Text Area"</code></pre><p>Two ways see the value of any variable, including <code>it</code>, are to use the <code>put</code> and <code>answer</code> commands. The <code>put</code> command writes the value to the message box if no destination container is specified. The <code>answer</code> command opens a dialog box containing the value. Both commands take an expression as an argument which can be just a variable name.</p><p>Once the variable <code>it</code> is set by using the <code>get</code> command, it can be used in subsequent expressions. For example, <code>multiply it by 2</code>.</p><h4 id="go-command" tabindex="-1">go Command</h4><p>The <code>go</code> command supports going to another card.

The field can also be directly edited.</p><p>When the &quot;Total&quot; button is clicked, the total of all the numbers entered on separate lines in the field is computed and displayed inside the field.

When the user clicks an option, it is highlighted by reversing the background and foreground colors of the selected line. The option text is also copied to another field to demonstrate that is was captured.</p><p>We need a way to remember the previously selected option. When an option is selected, if it was already selected then the option is deselected.</p><p>We can't associate a value with a container like a stack, card, button, or field.
