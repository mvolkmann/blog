The rules of English say the period belongs inside the quotes. Why? The title of the book doesn't contain a period in it and what is inside the quotes should to be the title of the book. Rebel! Don't follow this English rule!</p><h3>Wasteful Words</h3><p>Write what you mean in as few words as possible.</p><p>Instead of writing <span class="bordered">Tell me whether <b>or not</b> you like cheese. </span>, just write <span class="bordered">Tell me whether you like cheese. </span> We all know there's a possibility you don't like cheese. That's why we're asking.</p><p>Instead of writing <span class="bordered">The walls are two <b>different</b> colors. </span> write <span class="bordered">The walls are two colors. </span> Nobody will think it's possible you meant the walls are two colors that are blue and blue.</p><p>Instead of writing <span class="bordered">The colors of apples, bananas, and grapes are typically red, yellow, and green<b>, respectively</b>. </span> leave off <span class="bordered">, respectively </span> Who in their right mind would change the order?</p><h3>Gender</h3><p>Using gender specific pronouns like &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; ruffles feathers when there is no reason to specify a particular gender. Many people try be politically correct by alternating between them. English rules say you shouldn't use a generic word like &quot;them&quot; or &quot;they&quot;. I say do it anyway. Instead of writing <span class="bordered">When an employee is feeling angry, tell <b>her</b> to take a walk around the building. </span>, write <span class="bordered">When an employee is feeling angry, tell <b>them</b> to take a walk around the building.</span></p>
