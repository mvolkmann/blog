The rules of English say the period belongs inside the quotes. Why? The title of the book doesn't contain a period in it and what is inside the quotes should to be the title of the book. Rebel! Don't follow this English rule!</p><h3 id="wasteful-words">Wasteful Words</h3><p>Write what you mean in as few words as possible.</p><p>Instead of writing <span class="bordered">Tell me whether <b>or not</b> you like cheese. </span>, just write <span class="bordered">Tell me whether you like cheese. </span> We all know there's a possibility you don't like cheese.
